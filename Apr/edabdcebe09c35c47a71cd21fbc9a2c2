Gulen and his supporters around the world reject those charges.Last week's narrow win at the polls for Erdogan's referendum on changing Turkey's government system to a presidential one&nbsp;is expected to consolidate further powers under Erdogan's future leadership, with many opponents fearing growing autocracy or even one-man-rule in Turkey.&nbsp;While many Turks have taken to the streets of major cities to protest the outcome of the plebiscite, saying that the vote was rigged, Turkey's Higher Election Board (YSK) has rejected appeals to annul the referendum result.ss/msh&nbsp;(AFP, dpa)&nbsp;
