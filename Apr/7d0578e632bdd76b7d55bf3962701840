Director Maike Cruse says this is the most commercially successful weekend for the numerous galleries in Berlin. "Collectors from around the world come to the city, and the galleries mount their most important exhibitions of the year. It's a little like a large, freely accessible museum, spread over the entire city."Among the highlights this year is the Esther Schipper gallery, which is opening its new rooms on Potsdamer Strasse with works by Angela Bulloch and Anri Sala. Right next door, at Blain Southern, is the exhibition "Zeitlaich" by Jonas Burgert, a spectacular 22-meter-long painting.&nbsp;The bizarre sculpture group "Transit" by sculptor Georg Korner is also monumental, and will ultimately consist of 2600 figures. In his studio in the Wedding distict, the artist offers a glimpse into his work, which is soon to be completed.&nbsp;The former St. Agnes churchK nig Galerie offers an unusual atmosphere in the former St. Agnes church. After a self-imposed three-year creative break, Anselm Reyle is once again showing a new work, an extensive kinetic installation. At the Olbricht Foundation's "me Collectors Room" in the Mitte district, the complete editioned works of Sigmar Polke, about 200 of them, are being shown.&nbsp;Isabelle Huppert in a scene of "Elle"French actress Isabelle Huppert is bringing a touch of celebrity to this year's Gallery Weekend. On Friday she is introducing works by five contemporary artists at the Michael Fuchs gallery, also in Berlin's Mitte district. Huppert, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for her performance in the thriller "Elle," has always been a committed art-lover and works as a curator herself.&nbsp;is/ch/ms (dpa, gallery-weekend-berlin.de)
