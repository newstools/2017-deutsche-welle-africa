Roshani's mother has never been to school, nor has she ever used a computer, but that is something her 17-year-old daughter is helping to remedy. The girl from Dharavi, one of Asia's largest slums, in Mumbai, has invented a mobile application that helps her mother learn English, math and even seek medical advice from a nearby doctor.Roshani Shaikh (photo&nbsp;above) attends school in the morning, rushes home to finish her chores and spends the rest of the day coding at Dharavi Diary's learning center in Mumbai."In my school we have one computer, but we are only allowed to see it," said Shaikh. "We can't even touch it."Roshani Shaikh was one of the first 15 girls to join Dharavi Diary. The project, started by 36-year-old documentary filmmaker Nawneet Ranjan in 2014, aims to empower girls from the slum and give them a better chance at gaining an education and life skills."I would often see young girls play the role of their mothers, where they cooked, cleaned and took care of their younger siblings, and I wanted to engage with them and change the popular narrative," said Ranjan.The classes began with 15 girls and just two computers. Now they have more of bothAt the outset, Ranjan only had two computers for the girls, but material needs were not his greatest hurdle."Initially my biggest challenge was to convince the parents to send their daughters to the center," he said. "The parents would often question me: Why not take their sons, or take two boys and one girl from the family as a bargain."

The makeshift homes in Dharavi are no bigger than this and within these walls and in the alleyways, children like Shaikh have been exposed to child abuse, domestic violence, drug abuse and sexual harassment."These children have a very difficult childhood, and in their vicinity they experience a lot of violence, which basically suffocates their aspirations," Ranjan told DW.

We made a list of all the problems facing their community such as domestic violence, women's security, water scarcity and hygiene," he said.Mahek Shaikh is one of the now 200 girls Ranjan is training.

Confidence boosterRanjan said he has seen immense growth in Dharavi Diary girls. "They are independent and are actively participating in solving community problems and most importantly, they have a say in matters of their family," he said.Some parents are recognizing that it's worthwhile to educate their daughtersHe also explained that more parents are now opting for educating their girls instead of getting them married at a young age. His charges may indeed be better off."Many girls in my community would get married while they were in school and couldn't continue their education, but my mom doesn't even mention marriage now, after seeing me successfully invent things at the center," said Mahek Shaikh.
