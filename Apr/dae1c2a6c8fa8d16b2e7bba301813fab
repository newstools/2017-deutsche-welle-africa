Texts are read out at the 14 "Stations of the Cross"&nbsp;that Catholics believe Jesus passed while being taken&nbsp;to his crucifixion.The procession is a centuries-old traditionHigh securityThis year, the texts, by French theologian Anne-Marie Pelletier, among other things commemorate the fate of refugees and the victims of war and violence. The Colosseum itself is seen as a memorial to&nbsp;the martyrs of early Christianity who were put to death in the arena by Roman authorities because of their faith.The procession this year is taking place under high security amid fears about big public gatherings after truck attacks targeting pedestrians in Nice, Berlin, London and Stockholm.Police closed streets around the Colosseum to traffic hours before the event, and have been out in force to guard worshipers.
