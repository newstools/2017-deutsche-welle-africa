The streets reverberated with cries for justice.One week after disappearing from a nightclub, Garcia's body was found with reported signs of rape in a field on the outskirts of Gualeguay, a city some 234 kilometers (145 miles) northwest of Buenos Aires in the province of Entre Rios. An autopsy revealed strangulation as the cause of death.Activism against violenceAlongside studies in physical education in Gualeguay, Garcia had volunteered in poor neighborhoods and was active in the "Ni Una Menos" ("Not one less") movement fighting violence against women.

"On the one hand is the assassin, on the other the judge," she said.Argentina's president Macri called for Rossi's removal from the benchEntre Rios' government legislators and opposition alike have already submitted requests to the provincial legislature demanding Rossi's dismissal. The extent of public outcry about the case has been so great that even President Mauricio Macri called for the judge's removal."We cannot have these types of judges," Macri told the radio station Mitre on Saturday.cmb/jm (dpa, EFE)
