Dustin Johnson, the reigning US Open champion, had been the heavy favorite to win the year's first major golf championship, but suffered a lower back injury on Wednesday in a fall down stairs at a rental house.Johnson was seen walking back to the clubhouse shaking his head after undergoing a rigorous warm-up session before admitting defeat.The 24-hour drama reached its peak when Johnson arrived at the course and practiced his swings, hoping he could summon the strength to play through pain.After a physical therapy session, Johnson tested his swing for several minutes under the watchful gaze of his caddie, brother Austin Johnson, and swing coach Butch Harmon, then returned for more therapy.Johnson was due to have joined two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson and 2016 PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker in the day's final group.Not since Rory McIlroy withdrew from the 2015 British Open has a world number one not played in a major championship. The only other top-ranked player to miss the Masters was Tiger Woods, who did not play in 2014 after back surgery.
