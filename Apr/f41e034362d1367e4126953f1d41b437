The two women accused of murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un arrived at a heavily guarded courthouse in the Sepang district on Thursday morning wearing bullet-proof vests.It was the second court appearance for the suspects, Doan Thi Huong, 28, from Vietnam, and Siti Aisyah, 25, from Indonesia, but not the last one as the hearing was postponed until late May. The prosecution team requested that the case be transferred to a higher court and the women be jointly tried for murder.If convicted, the two will face death by hanging.The suspects stand&nbsp;accused of assassinating Kim Jong-Nam in Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13 by smearing his face with VX, a toxic nerve agent that the United Nations classifies as a weapon of mass destruction.Kim Jong Nam had lived in de facto exile from North Korea for many yearsBoth women have attested their innocence and claimed they were told they were taking part in a prank show.Prosecutors charged them on March 1 alongside four men who&nbsp;Malaysian authorities identified as North Koreans. The men reportedly fled Malaysia to Pyongyang the same day as the attack.Three other persons initially of interest, including a North Korean diplomat, were subsequently released.&nbsp;High-profile defector Hwang Jang-Yop survived numerous assassination attempts before dying of natural causes at the age of 87. Hwang, who had been one of the leading ideologues of the North's isolationist regime, escaped to South Korea in 1997. Just months before his death in 2010, Seoul authorities arrested two North Korean military officers over one of many plots to kill him.The execution of Kim Jong-Un's uncle Jang Song Thaek, once the second most powerful man in the isolated country, sent shockwaves beyond North Korea's borders. Many media outlets wrongly reported that he was fed to hungry dogs, as punishment for his "betrayal" of the ruling family. In reality, he was shot, according to Pyongyang officials and South Korean intelligence.In 2015, Seoul's security services reported that North Korean Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol was executed by an anti-aircraft gun. However, National Intelligence Service (NIS) soon appeared to backtrack from the report, saying that Hyon might still be alive. Reports of other brutal executions, involving artillery shells and flamethrowers, have also been difficult to confirm.North Korean defector and well-known dissident Park Sang-hak was also targeted by a Pyongyang-linked hitman. In 2011, South Korean authorities arrested a former North Korean commando over the plot to assassinate Park Sang-hak with a poison-tipped needle.The estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un was reportedly poisoned by two women at a Kuala Lumpur airport. While details remain sketchy, it is widely believed that the killers were sent by the North Korean regime. The 46-year-old Kim Jong-Nam had been living abroad after falling from grace in 2001 for visiting Disneyland in Tokyo.High political stakesThe murder escalated tensions between the Korean Peninsula's northern and southern neighbors, with South Korea accusing the North of a planned assassination and Pyongyang countering that Malaysia acted in collusion with South Korea to kill the estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader.&nbsp;Both countries issued travel bans on one another's citizens and withdrew their respective ambassadors.The travel ban was lifted in March after the two nations reached an agreement allowing Kim's body to be flown back to Pyongyang&nbsp;and permitting the release of Malaysian citizens held in the North Korean capital.
