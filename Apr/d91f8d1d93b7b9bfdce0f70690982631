Don't say German police can't deliver.A pizza delivery man in the town of Gaggenau, in the southwestern state of Baden-W rttemberg, failed to yield to a vehicle transporting medical supplies early Saturday, causing a collision that damaged at least one of the cars along with a traffic light and a street lamp.Though both the 46-year-old pizza delivery man and the 24-year-old medical supplies driver were taken to the hospital with serious injuries, police at the scene found the pizza intact and were able to deliver it to its waiting customers without much fuss."The pizzas were still hot and they were close to where they were meant to end up, so we simply completed the delivery," a police spokesman said, according to German news agency DPA.Damage caused by the accident amounted to around 20,000 euros ($21,790), the police said in a statement.
