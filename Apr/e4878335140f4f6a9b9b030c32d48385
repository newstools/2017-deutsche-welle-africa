Saudi Arabia intends to refrain in future from&nbsp;asking for more weapons from Germany, and to concentrate instead on economic cooperation in other sectors, according to an interview in the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" published on Sunday."We accept the German reticence with regard to exports to Saudi Arabia; we know the political background," Saudi Deputy Economy Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri told the magazine.

There were no representatives of armaments companies in the business delegation accompanying her, though the German government has previously said that weapons could still be delivered to Saudi Arabia on a case-by-case basis.At the talks in the commercial hub of Jeddah, Merkel called for an end to the Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen."We believe in the UN-led process of diplomatic resolution," she said. "We do not think that there can be a military solution to this conflict."Merkel's visit is aimed at deepening economic and security tiesShe said something had to be done to prevent even more people in the already impoverished country from being&nbsp;brought into an "extremely bad humanitarian situation," while conceding that Saudi Arabia was not the only party that had to accept compromises.The Saudi government has been intervening in the war in Yemen for more than two years, leading a Sunni Arab coalition that has been bombing positions of Shiite Houthi rebels, which&nbsp;Riyadh sees as proxy forces for its regional rival, Iran. In view of the large number of civilian casualties in the strikes, even the United States, a close ally of the kingdom, has called for the attacks to cease.Military and police trainingDespite German reservations about Saudi military actions, an agreement was signed during Merkel's visit that provides for German Bundeswehr soldiers to help train their Saudi counterparts, a government spokesman in Berlin said.Under the deal, Saudi soldiers are to&nbsp;receive training at Bundeswehr facilities, the spokesman said, giving no further details.A declaration of intent was also signed on police training cooperation, according to information from the government. The scheme would see German federal police giving instruction to Saudi border police, among other things.
