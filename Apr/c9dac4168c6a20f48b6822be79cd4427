Pope Francis repeated his claim on Saturday that some migrant holding facilities in Europe are tantamount to "concentration camps," even after some Jewish organizations urged him to stop using the controversial term.A German reporter, noting that the comment had been met with shock in Germany, asked the pope if he had made a linguistic slip when he first made the comments last week.Speaking on his way home from Egypt, Francis reiterated, "There are refugee camps that are true concentration camps."

There is no comparison to the magnitude of that tragedy."Following the pope's initial statement, the International Auschwitz Committee (IAC) said the Francis' comments were "legitimate."&nbsp;"I&nbsp;don't consider it outrageous," Christoph Heubner, executive vice president of the IAC, which was founded by survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, told the German dpa news agency&nbsp;in Berlin.&nbsp;Pope Francis had said it with good intentions, Heubner said, adding, "He exaggerated in order to move hearts. That is legitimate."&nbsp;bik/sms (AP, dpa)
