Europe's largest automaker said Friday it planned to invest heavily in the development of better combustion engines for its vehicles.On Friday, VW Group Chief Executive Matthias M ller said at a conference in Vienna, Austria&nbsp;the company would spend some 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) on this conventional technology by 2022.He added the aim of the effort was to increase fuel efficiency, particularly through more advanced injection&nbsp;systems and lightweight design programs, which could enhance&nbsp;engine efficiency by some 15 percent in comparison to what the market had to offer today.M ller admitted, though, that "although combustion engines would remain essential for at least 20 more years, the future is electric."Double-track strategyFor Volkswagen, that's a case of doing one thing without neglecting the other. Following its huge emissions test cheating scandal, the Wolfsburg-based carmaker announced as early as November last year that it aspired to become the world's leader in electric cars by 2025.
