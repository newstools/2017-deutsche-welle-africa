Paraguay's constitution has prohibited re-election since the document&nbsp;was passed in 1992 after the fall of a brutal 35-year dictatorship three years earlier.Confrontations over the weekend escalated with protesters storming the building and setting fire to furniture and paper. Police used water cannon and fired rubber bullets to drive protesters away from the building while firefighters extinguished the blazes inside. According to authorities, some 30 people were injured in the clashes.Canceled sessionsDue to Friday's violence, Saturday's and Monday's sessions of the Chamber of Deputies were canceled."We will evaluate the situation on Tuesday," said legislative president Hugo Velazquez.Cartes said that Vice Minister of Internal Security Lorenzo Lezcano would replace Rojas as interior minister, and police subcommander Luis Carlos Rojas would take over for Sotelo.ksb/gsw (AP, Reuters)
