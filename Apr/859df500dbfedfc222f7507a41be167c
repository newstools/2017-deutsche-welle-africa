The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank spring meetings started on Thursday bringing the two multilateral institutions' 189 members face-to-face with the unusual challenge of a US government noisily at odds with some of their most important positions, including free trade, financial regulation and climate change.The IMF in particular has sounded warnings against Trump's "America First" agenda which aims to shrink US trade deficits with potential measures to restrict imports. The fund&nbsp;has argued in its latest economic forecasts that protectionist policies would crimp global growth that is starting to gain traction.Opening the meetings in Washington, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the IMF&nbsp;would press for "a fair and level playing field," adding that this meant "no use of distortive measures, no protectionist measures.""The IMF is not a trade organization, but we are concerned about trade because it has been a major engine for growth," Lagarde noted.At the same time, she sought to downplay differences with the Trump administration, saying that from the various contacts that she'd had with the administration so far, "I have every reason to believe we will make progress."In addition to warnings on trade, the IMF on Wednesday unveiled two studies pointing out dangers from fiscal proposals that Trump is considering. These included warnings that his tax reform ideas could fuel financial risk-taking and raise public debt enough to hurt growth.
