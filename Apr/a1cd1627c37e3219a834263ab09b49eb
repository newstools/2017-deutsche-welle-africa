As part of a campaign to reduce food waste among consumers and along the entire supply chain, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in 2012 launched the "Too good for the bin" initiative to engage citizens, companies and organizations in saving food.&nbsp; The goal of the initiative is to cut in half the estimated 11 million tons of wasted food by 2030.&nbsp;The average German throws away 82 kilos (181 pounds) of unused food every year, much of it preventable waste that impacts the environment and the economy.Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt on Wednesday awarded contestants in four categories from 168 entries. In the engagement category, the start-up dumpling maker "Kn delkult" won for using unsold bread from local bakeries and turning it into dumplings sold in glass jars. The three founders of Kn delkult purchase bread at discounted prices from bakeries and transform a product that would have gone to waste into a non-perishable food item.For every 3,000 glass jars sold, Kn delkult is able to save more than a ton of bread from going into the garbage. Established in 2016, Kn delkult received start-up capital through a crowd-funding campaign and is now working to expand its logistics and production process.Kn del is a traditional German food.
