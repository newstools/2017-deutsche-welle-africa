Alitalia unions mounted a 24-hour strike on Wednesday morning to protest planned job and salary cuts as part of a larger scheme to rescue the struggling Italian airline.The walkout started after a government-mediated meeting with management over the loss-making carrier's turnaround plan had failed to yield an agreement."We're striking to say 'no' to a non-credible industrial plan, one aiming solely at short-term survival without laying any basis for a relaunch of the company," said Uiltrasporti, one of the six unions taking part in the strike.Painful restructuring aheadThe plan, which was unveiled in March, called for slashing operating costs by 1 billion euros (just over $1 billion) and cutting 2,000 office and ground staff by the end of 2019. The airline currently has a workforce of 12,500.
