Tajani told reporters in London after meeting with&nbsp;May that&nbsp;a&nbsp;new UK government would be a positive move, especially before official Brexit negotiations get underway."I think is good not only for the UK, but also for us because we will have the same prime minister, the same ministers, the same negotiator for the next years," .Britain voted to leave the EU last June and May formally triggered Article 50, the EU's divorce clause, on March 29, beginning what are set to be at least two years of difficult negotiations before Britain finally leaves.Tanjani said he wanted a "framework" deal on Britain's exit from the EU to&nbsp;be settled before the end of 2017, allowing negotiations to begin on the future relationship "immediately thereafter.""And we [will] know the real situation in the UK, we [will] know the government it's better for us to work with the same government and not with a potential election campaign," he added.European politicians&nbsp;had expressed fears that concluding negotiations so close to a national vote in 2020 - when the next general election would have been held if not this June - could have forced May to seek a more hardline Brexit settlement in order to assuage core Conservative voters and her 50 or so more hardline Brexit-supporting MPs.
