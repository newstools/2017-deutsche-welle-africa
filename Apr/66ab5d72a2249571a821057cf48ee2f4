Almost seven years after the deadly stampede at the Love Parade techno music festival in Duisburg, a&nbsp;court in nearby D sseldorf announced Monday that a criminal trial against 10 festival organizers and city employees should go ahead.Panic broke out at the festival venue in 2010The 10 defendants, four staff of festival organizer Lopavent and six Duisburg city administrators, face charges including negligent manslaughter and causing bodily harm.The higher court overruled&nbsp;a local court which had rejected the trial last year on the basis that there was likely not enough evidence for the prosecution to be successful. It ruled that there was a "sufficient probability" of convictions and that the lower court had set "overly high demands" of the chances of conviction to make its decision.In the July 24, 2010 disaster, 21 people were trampled to death in a mass panic as the narrow entrance tunnel to the venue, a former railway yard, became a lethal bottleneck. Hundreds of concertgoers were injured.Read more: 'I'm always looking for the emergency exit,' Love Parade survivor saysThe tragedy deeply impacted Germany and sent shockwaves throughout the world.
