The Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, wrote in an article for the "Daily Express" that Spain was attempting to "[manipulate] the European Council for its own, narrow political interests" and that this effort was being supported by the Council's President, Donald Tusk.After the Brexit vote, Spain reasserted its long-standing desire to see Spanish-British co-sovereignty in Gibraltar, with "the Rock" eventually becoming completely Spanish.The article came the same day as a phone conversation between Picardo and British Prime Minister Theresa May. A statement following the call from Downing Street said the prime minister would "never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes."Rocky issueGibraltar is a&nbsp;rocky British outpost on the southern tip of Spain.A proposal from the European Union envisions offering Spain a right to veto over Gibraltar's future trade relations with the bloc.

Three days later,&nbsp;Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dispatched a naval force to take back the territory. Argentina surrendered on June 14."Thirty-five years ago this week another woman prime minister sent a task force half way across the world to defend the freedom of another small group of British people against another Spanish speaking country," Howard said on Sky News, "and I'm absolutely certain that our current prime minister will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar."Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said on Monday that "the Spanish government is a little surprised by the tone of comments coming out of Britain, a country known for its composure."In an interview on Sunday, he said he viewed the EU's stance positively.mz/msh (Reuters, dpa)&nbsp;
