A German court in the western city of Cologne on Monday convicted a 16-year-old Syrian refugee for planning to carry out a terror attack.The regional court sentenced the defendant, whose name wasn't made public in line with privacy laws, to two years in youth prison.Police arrested the boy at a refugee center near Cologne, where he was living with his parents, in September. A battery carrier with wires, sewing needles and a small butane gas canister were found in the defendant's possession during the raid.The court found enough evidence that the boy had declared himself willing to carry&nbsp;out an attack in an internet chat with "a person close to the 'Islamic State' in Israel." He also received instructions on how to make a bomb.Judges said the terror plan was in a very early stage and there was no threat to the public.The court attributed the boy's radicalization to loneliness at the refugee center and spending most of his time on a cell phone."In addition, he spent a lot of time online and with&nbsp;chat contacts," the court said. "Through these contacts he developed an Islamist-jihadist worldview."The boy denied his&nbsp;intent to carry out an attack was&nbsp;serious.&nbsp; The court didn't believe him.&nbsp;Among the witness was the boy's father, a merchant who described himself in a statement as belonging the opposition against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.The boy came to Germany in 2015 with both his parents and sister after they fled the civil war in Syria.cw/kms (AFP, AP, dpa)
