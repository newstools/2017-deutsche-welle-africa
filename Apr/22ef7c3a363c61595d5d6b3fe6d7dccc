The US economy slowed dramatically in the first quarter of 2017, with GDP weakening andexpanding by only&nbsp;0.7 percent, down sharply from the 2.1 percent expansion seen in the fourth quarter of 2016.The American Commerce Department reported Friday that the results were&nbsp;below analysts' expectations for 1.1 percent GDP growth, although the figure was&nbsp;only slightly below the 0.8 percent increase in the same quarter of last year.The results mark a damp start to the presidency of Donald Trump, who reaches 100 days in office Saturday and was elected on a message of a protectionist economic revival. Trump has taken credit for increased consumer confidence, growing employment and record gains on the stock market in recent months.

It&nbsp;had seen sharp cutbacks in recent quarters, reflecting reductions in exploration and drilling as energy prices declined.mds/hg (AP, AFP)
