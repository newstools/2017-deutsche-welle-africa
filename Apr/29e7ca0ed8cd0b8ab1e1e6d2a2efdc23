He has denied the charges, though he has refused a summons by the Senate to explain himself.Widespread corruptionThe funds, totaling some $43 million (about 40 million euros), were found stashed in a private apartment in an upscale district of Lagos and&nbsp;were claimed by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA). The find prompted Buhari to also suspend NIA chief Ayo Oke.A committee headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo now has 14 days to conduct an investigation into both men and present its findings to the president.According to Transparency International, Nigeria is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
