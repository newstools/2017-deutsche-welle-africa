The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) said a March meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad undertaken by the group's current parliamentary president, Spaniard Pedro Agramunt, had tarnished the 47-nation international organization dedicated to the defense of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.A cross-party group of PACE's members "resolved that it has no confidence in Pedro Agramunt as President of the Assembly," the organization said in a statement on Friday, adding that the 65-year-old Spanish senator would be prohibited from traveling, attending meetings or speaking on behalf of the assembly.A human rights leader visits a suspected war criminal&nbsp;The assembly's decision stemmed from Agramunt's controversial Russia-sponsored visit to Syria last month, during which he met and was photographed with Assad alongside Russian deputy Leonid Slutsky.

He did not inform PACE ahead of time of his intentions to visit the war-torn country.Agramunt did not attend Friday's hearing and has refused to resign as president of the human rights body.
