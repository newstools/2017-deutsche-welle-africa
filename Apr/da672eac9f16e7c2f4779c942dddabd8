Le Pen told the LCI television channel on Sunday: "I don't think France is responsible for the Vel d'Hiv," referring to the role French police played in the round-up of more than 13,000 Jews at the Vel d'Hiv cycling track which was ordered by Nazi officers in 1942."I consider that France and the Republic were based in London during the (Nazi) occupation," she said. The British capital was where Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the free French forces, lived in exile during World War II while France's Vichy regime collaborated with Nazi Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Vichy regime was not France," Le Pen said,&nbsp;describing the wartime authority as "illegal." She added that this in no way exonerated those who participated in "the vile roundup of Vel d'Hiv and all the atrocities committed during that period.""I think that generally speaking if there are people responsible, it's those who were in power at the time. It's not France," Le Pen said.France had "taught our children that they have all the reasons to criticize (the country) and to only see, perhaps, the darkest aspects of our history," she added. "So, I want them to be proud of being French again," she said.France's trouble with anti-SemitismThe Vel' d'Hiv Roundup was a Nazi directed raid and mass arrest of Jews in Paris by the French police on 16 and 17 July 1942. The bicycle velodrome was a stadium where a majority of the victims were temporarily confined. The roundup was one of several aimed at eradicating the Jewish population in France, both in the occupied zone and in the free zone.Former President Jacques Chirac and current leader Francois Hollande have both apologized, although Chirac's Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterand refused to acknowledge responsibility for the deportations, saying in 1994: "The republic had nothing to do with that. France is not responsible."
