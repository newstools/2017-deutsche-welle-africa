A first half header from Max Kruse and a late strike from substitute Florian Kainz mean&nbsp;the Green-Whites have won 23 of their 39 points in the last nine games.Hamburg, who came in to the game with 13 points from their last 6 matches, were without&nbsp;key defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos, who has vastly improved HSV's defending since joining in January. They were almost ruing his absence just seconds in. Max Kruse was left in oceans of space in the area but gave Christian Mathenia the chance to make a fine save when he should have put the hosts ahead.The visitors were also missing top scorer Bobby Wood but his absence didn't seem to trouble Markus Gisdol's side quite as much, as they took the lead soon after. Aaron Hunt clipped in a cross from the right and Wood's replacement Michael Gregoritsch rose highest to guide a firm header inside Felix Wiedwald's far post.Michael Gregoritsch's early strike counted for nothing in the endFlorian Grillitsch almost levelled ten minutes later but dragged a close-range shot wide before skipper Zlatko Junozovic's 21st-minute free kick thumped against the post. Bremen's pressure finally told just before the break. Santiago Garcia's deep cross from the left was cushioned expertly in to Max Kruse's path by Finn Bartels and the Germany international nodded in his fifth goal in six league games.Bremen started the second period in equally insistent fashion, with Bartels in particular threatening to give the hosts the lead. But Hamburg weren't out of the contest, Matthias Ostrzolek drawing a smart save from Wiedwald 55 minutes in. Garcia was stretchered off for Bremen with 15 minutes remaining and looked in some pain but it proved no distraction to his team as Kainz ran on to a Kruse through ball to blast home with his left foot and seal another Werder win.&nbsp;&nbsp;
