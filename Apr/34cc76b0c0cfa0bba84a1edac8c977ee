Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Bayern MunichUpon their return to domestic duties, Bayern Munich couldn't shake off their midweek defeat to Real Madrid&nbsp;as they dropped points in Leverkusen. The draw leaves Bayern eight points clear of Leipzig - a team they face on Matchday 33 -&nbsp;with five games left.Leverkusen&nbsp;started well and might have taken the lead inside the opening 10 minutes had the ball not squirmed away from Kevin Volland at the pivotal moment on the edge of the six-yard box.Robert Lewandowski's absence was noticeable throughout, especially when Bayern somehow failed to score from three chances in 11 seconds. David Alaba hesitated in the box, but when he did shoot Tin Jedvaj acrobatically blocked the shot with his chest. Javi Martinez had a go, but Omer Toprak threw himself in the way, before Arturo Vidal clipped the ball over Bernd Leno and headed goalwards, only for a scrambling Toprak to get back and clear off the line.Inspired, Leverkusen&nbsp;kept a suddenly improved Bayern out. Leno made a huge save with his face to deny Kingsley Coman from close-range before Thiago headed over a cross&nbsp;deliviered&nbsp;perfectly to&nbsp;him by Juan Bernat.The game looked like it would turn in Bayern's favor when Jedvaj picked up two yellow cards in less than 10 minutes, but&nbsp;the hosts&nbsp;stayed compact at the urging of recently appointed coach Tayfun Korkut and kept Bayern quiet even after they called on Arjen Robben to come off the bench and save the day.With not much time left, it was in fact the 10 men of Leverkusen who looked more likely to score - but Karim Bellarabi snapped at anything that came his way.Philipp Lahm should have won it for Bayern with six minutes left, but&nbsp;the effort from the Bayern captain&nbsp;trickled past the far post and summed up his team's&nbsp;afternoon in one moment.The point leaves Leverkusen four points clear of relegation - and just five short of a Europa League spot.Relive the action here:
