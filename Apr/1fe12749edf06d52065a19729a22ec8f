The Bulgarian state security service DANS said the five suspects, who are alleged of being involved with a terrorist group in Syria, had entered the country from Romania, and were on their way to Turkey on a train where they were apprehended at the Kapitan Andreevo border checkpoint.Four of the suspects have reportedly been expelled; the fifth, a minor, is in care of the authorities until he can be handed over to his family in Germany. The adolescent had apparently intended&nbsp;to join an unnamed terror group in Syria, a statement by DANS said.Bulgaria expelled a total of 22 foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist activities in 2016 alone. The border between the Balkan state and Turkey has become a crossover point not only for thousands of refugees into Europe but also for radicalized Europeans trying to reach Syria.&nbsp;Hundreds of West European "Islamic State" (IS) sympathizers have travelled to Syria via Turkey in the past few years to join the militant organization and other Islamist groups.ss/msh&nbsp;(dpa, Reuters)&nbsp;
