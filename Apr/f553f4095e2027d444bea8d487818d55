Six hundred delegates of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party rejected a late agenda item from Petry billed by her as a decision to offer voters pragmatic civic policies instead of nationalism tending toward far-right ideology.Initially, it remained unclear whether the AfD would use its weekend conference to pick lead candidates for its campaign when Germany elects in federal Bundestag parliament on September 24.Last Wednesday, Petry announced she was no longer available to head the AfD campaign team in what was seen as a challenge to inner party rivals, co-leader J rg Meuthen and Alexander Gauland from Brandenburg state.Meuthen, in his opening remarks, accused Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Social Democratic party's (SPD) new leader Martin Schulz of conducting politics to the "detriment of the German folk," a term with far-right connotations.If AfD did not bring about a decisive gear change, "then the irretrievable changes to our homeland will, with mathematical certainty, turn it into a&nbsp;Muslim-shaped country," Meuthen asserted to AfD delegates' applause.&nbsp;Petry, herself, accused Germany's churches that have been sharply critical of the anti-immigrant AfD of issuing "ugly, depreciating and polarizing remarks."Read:&nbsp;Cologne protests as AfD comes to townOutside the AfD venue - Cologne's tightly-guarded Maritim Hotel - up to 50,000 anti-AfD protestors were anticipated by organizers.They were from some 70 diverse groups alarmed by the AfD's rise since 2013 and its prospects of entering the federal Bundestag parliament.The AfD already has opposition footholds in 11 of Germany's 16 regional assemblies.Police police spokesman Christoph Gilles told N-TV television that police operations involving 4,000 personnel were running to plan.Squads acting on information gathered had positioned themselves as protestors, including leftists, arrived in busses, also on Cologne's opposite Rhine river bank, Gilles said.Read:&nbsp;Maritim Hotel faces backlash over AfD Cologne congressRead: 10 things you need to know about the AfDRegional WDR public television reported a few scuffles before midday, adding that two police officers had been hurt and one suspect was arrested.The news agency AFP said one officer suffered a facial injury while escorting AfD party members into the hotel near Heumarkt, a key inner-city location.Deutsche Welle reporter in Cologne Elizabeth Schumacher said the police presence was far stronger than on New Year's Eve, a&nbsp;neuralgic moment in city history in 2016."I've never seen something like this. There are a huge amount of armoured (police) vehicles," Schumacher said.

Surveys show it polling between seven and 11 percent, a steep drop from the 15 percent support it drew late last year that even eclipsed the ecologist opposition Greens.Chancellor Angela Merkel's acceptance of some one million asylum seekers was seized in 2015 by the AfD to assail multicultural policies.In January, Petry attended a&nbsp;gathering in Koblenz of other European populists, including France's Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands.DW's Schumacher said Petry sudden withdrawal last Wednesday might not have just been strategy to make an AfD comeback at a later moment, as Angela Merkel did within the conservative CDU in 2002 before she first become chancellor in 2005.Petry had become "increasingly unpopular in recent months" as the AfD poll numbers have been dipping, Schumacher said."What people might also not know - if they haven't seen her - is that she is heavily pregnant, Schumacher said, adding "she also has some health issues to think about."Cologne's mayor Henriette Reker described the AfD's choice of venue as a "provocation, because Cologne stands exactly for what the AfD doesn't advocate;&nbsp;that is tolerance, that is diversity and that is the welcoming of people who come to Cologne, whether they're seeking sanctuary here have chosen it as&nbsp;their central place to live."Police on Saturday morning&nbsp;escorted 13 marital couples through barriers to ceremonies in Cologne's historic council chambers, near the AfD's hotel conference venue.One bride Charlotte Reisch said being escorted by two police motorcycles was something special."It was a small shock. One had a little bit of panic," Reisch said. "But what should one do?"ipj/rc (AFP, dpa,
