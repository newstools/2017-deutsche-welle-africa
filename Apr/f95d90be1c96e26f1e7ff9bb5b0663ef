The Hungarian government has one month to respond to the letter. Brussels will then consider if any further steps are warranted. These could include referral to the European Court of Justice and possible financial penalties.Orban criticizes EU criticismOrban called the accusations against Hungary "absurd."Standing before European lawmakers, Orban&nbsp;described the contested law as a "minor amendment" that applies to 28 universities and not just to the CEU. He described the flare-up around the law as "absurd," likening it to a pre-emptive murder conviction, given that the CEU continues to operate normally at present."It's almost like someone being accused of murder, then he's convicted, while the alleged victim is alive and kicking, moreover, pointing fingers at the convicted, crying: 'Murderer!'," Orban said.Orban attacks SorosGeorge Soros' Central European University faces possible closureOrban had even stronger words for CEU&nbsp;founder&nbsp;George Soros.

CEU at the center of controversyThe EU's formal letter&nbsp;focuses on the law passed on April 4 that requires foreign universities operating in Hungary also have a campus in their home country. The law is seen as aimed squarely at Central European University, which has been operating in Budapest since 1993. Despite being accredited in the US state of New York, the university does not have a campus in the United States.Orban has accused the university of maintaining an unfair advantage over other Hungarian institutions because it confers degrees that are recognized in both Hungary and the United States, However, he denied wanting to shut it down.
