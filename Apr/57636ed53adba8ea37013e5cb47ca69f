The 26-year-old center back required an operation on his wrist which was broken when the team bus was struck by a pipe bomb on Tuesday.The post, written in Spanish, features Bartra&nbsp;pictured with his family in hospital and he says he is grateful for the support he's received. They are my everything, the reason I struggle to overcome obstacles and this has been the worst of my life, an experience I would not wish on&nbsp;anyone in this world, he wrote. The pain, the panic and the uncertainty of not knowing what was going on, or how long it would last were the longest and hardest 15 minutes of my life.Marc Bartra's Instagram post I think the shock is decreasing more and more and, at the same time, it adds to the desire to live, to fight, to work, to laugh, to cry, to feel, to love, to believe, to play, to train, to continue to enjoy my people, loved ones, companions, my passion, to defend, to smell the grass as I do before the game starts and motivate me. The only thing I ask is for everyone to live in peace and to leave behind the wars. These days when I look at my wrist, swollen and badly wounded, you know what I feel? Pride. I look at it proudly, thinking all the damage they wanted to do to us on Tuesday stayed in this. Thanks to the doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and people who helped me recover. To the thousands and thousands of people, media, organisations of all kinds, the club and colleagues, who have given me your support and affection as small as it may be has filled me with incredible strength to continue on and on. I needed to write and unburden myself and to settle everything so I can just think about getting 100% as soon as possible. Bartra was the only player injured in the attack, for which a man has recently been detained. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said on Thursday that the defender could be back in action in four weeks time.mp (AP/AFP)
