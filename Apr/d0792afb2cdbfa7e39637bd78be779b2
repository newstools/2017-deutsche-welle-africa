Authorities said they are investigating the incident as a possible terror attack.The two officers were shot while trying to arrest the man, who was later subdued and taken into custody. Neither of the officers suffered life-threatening injuries.A search of the man's apartment yielded several weapons and supplies to make Molotov cocktails, French Interior Minister Matthias Fekl said in a statement.The suspect's mother was also detained as part of the investigation.The shooting on the Indian Ocean island comes a week after a police officer was killed and two others wounded on Paris' Champs Elysees.&nbsp;The so-called "Islamic State" claimed credit for that attack, in which the gunman was killed by police.The attack terrified the French capital just days before&nbsp;Sunday's first-round of the country's presidential election in which security and Islamist extremism were major themes.
