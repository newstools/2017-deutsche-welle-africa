Berlin has demanded his release, but the demands were flatly rejected by Ankara, with President Erdogan labeling the reporter a "terrorist agent" and a "German spy.""Thank God he has been arrested," the Turkish president said in March.Yucel could face over 10 years in jail if he is convicted on charges for producing terrorist propaganda and incitement to hatred.dj/kms (dpa, AFP, epd)
