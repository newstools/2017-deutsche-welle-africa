Some 6.7 million eligible voters in Serbia are choosing between current Prime Minister Aleksander Vucic of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and 10 opposition candidates in the&nbsp;first round of elections for the country's president.Opinion polls have&nbsp;consistently put&nbsp;Vucic&nbsp;on track to take&nbsp;about half of the votes. Should the current prime minister secure at least 50 percent of the vote on Sunday, he would avoid a potential run-off election against the second-place contender that is&nbsp;slated for April 16.The office of president is largely ceremonial, but analysts say that if Vucic wins, they expect him&nbsp;to maintain a hold on power by appointing a loyal ally from his party to succeed him as prime minister.Critics have accused Vucic of authoritarian tendencies during the campaign, saying he has taken control over Serbia's media. They complain of inaccurate reports that demonize the prime minister's opponents while giving them no space to respond to the accusations.Vucic's supporters, on the other hand, say he has a good track record of keeping the country under control in a&nbsp;troubled region. He&nbsp;has promised economic and social reforms while maintaining a balancing act oftrying to join the EU and maintaining a good relationship with traditional ally Russia.Joker in second Luka Maksimovic, better known as Beli, is causing a stir in the Serbian presidential electionJust several other&nbsp;candidates are believed to have a chance at earning more than 10 percent of the vote on Sunday. Among them is a university student who threw his hat into the ring with an eye-catching alter ego that shook up the entire race.Luka Maksimovic, more commonly known as Ljubisa Preletacevic or Beli, is a 25-year-old student that is in second place in some polls. Maksimovic became a hit on social media by lampooning&nbsp;Serbian politicians as self-interested or corrupt&nbsp;while sporting a white suit, loafers, massive jewelry and a ponytail.&nbsp;His antics include a tweet of an edited image of US President Donald Trump holding up a sign that states "go and vote for Beli" and imagining himself as Gandalf from the "Lord of the Rings" fantasy book series.Uphill battleSurveys of voters have also put two more traditional political figures in the running behind Vucic.One of them is Vuk Jeremic, a former foreign minister. Jeremic ran for UN Secretary General last year and previously served in the UN General Assembly. He is running as an independent candidate with support from right-leaning opposition groups.There's also Sasa Jankovic, who earned praise as Serbia's first Ombudsman, the citizens' rights defender, before abandoning the position to run for president. Jankovic is supported by left-leaning opposition parties and is also running as an independent.Vucic's opponents have struggled to get media coverage for their campaigns, with one Serbian social research group estimating that the country's mainstream media have granted the prime minister more than 120 times as much news coverage as&nbsp;Jeremic and Jankovic combined.An international security agency will manage the voting process for Serbians in Kosovo. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has opened four polling stations across Kosovo in preparation for the election. While Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, Serbia still considers Kosovo a part of its territory.
