Opinion polls have shown far-right Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron qualifying on April 23 for a run-off election two weeks later in May. But the gap between them and conservative Francois Fillon and far-leftist Jean Melenchon has been narrowing.A recent OpinionWay poll puts Macron and Le Pen both on 22 percent for the first round of the election, with Fillon on 21 percent and Melenchon up one point at 18 percent.Two other polls had Macron just ahead of Le Pen in the first round&nbsp;and beating her comfortably in the second. An IFOP poll published on Tuesday indicated up to 30 percent of voters may abstain in the first round.&nbsp;The election will move into a run-off round on May 7, provided no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the vote on in round one on Sunday.Macron calls for strong EUMacron called for a "confident France"&nbsp;and defended his pro-EU position&nbsp;at his biggest rally of the campaign to date, attracting 20,000 people to the Bercy arena in Paris.&nbsp;"Of 11 candidates, 10 want to take us back to a fantasy vision of the past," he said. "I am for both a strong France and an ambitious Europe."The former economy minister also reiterated his desire for a "solid and equal alliance" with Germany.Macron had criticized Germany's disproportionate economic power in the EU in a Monday interview with Germany's Funke media group, saying the current situation "isn't good for Germany's own economy, nor for the economy in the eurozone," he had said.Emmanuel Macron (L) and Marine Le Pen remain the frontrunners in a tightening race'Savage globalization'Le Pen meanwhile promised to suspend all immigration and shield voters from what she called "savage globalization.""I will protect you.

"It is a choice between a France that is rising again and a France that is sinking.""Mass immigration is not an opportunity for France, it's a tragedy for France."The crowd booed&nbsp;the EU and its border-free Schengen area, from which Le Pen has said she would remove France if elected."The French sometimes have fewer rights than foreigners - even illegal ones," she claimed.
