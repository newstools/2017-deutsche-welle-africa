The world will hold its breath Saturday as North Korea celebrates the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il-Sung.The US-based 38 North monitoring group reported late on Wednesday that satellite images suggested Pyongyang is prepared to conduct its next nuclear test, describing the test site as "primed and ready.""Commercial satellite imagery of North Korea's Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site from April 12 shows continued activity around the North Portal, new activity in the Main Administrative Area, and a few personnel around the site's Command Center," the group said.With 700,000 active troops and another 4.5 million in the reserves, North Korea can call upon almost a quarter of its population to serve in the army at any given time. Every male in the country is required to undertake some form of military training and can be called to serve at any time. The North's bloated army is believed to outnumber its southern neighbor's by two-to-one.The 2016 Global Firepower Index revealed the North had, as part of a far-reaching arsenal, 70 submarines, 4,200 tanks, 458 fighter jets, 572 fixed-wing attack aircraft among others. The picture above from 2013 shows leader Kim Jong Un ordering strategic rocket forces to be on standby to strike US and South Korean targets at any time.Every year, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens role through the streets of the capital Pyongyang to take part in the North's military parades. Preparations for the rallies often begin months in advance and are usually held on an important anniversary of the party or Kim Jong Un's family.Despite pressure from the international community, Pyongyang has made no secret of its nuclear ambitions. Alongside its ritual ballistic missile tests, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on five occasions, two of which in 2016. The country claimed that the last warhead it tested could be attached to a rocket. Alongside the United States, Pyongyang views its neighbors South Korea and Japan as its two other main enemies. North Korea's has used US' military exercises in the regions as means of galvanizing its people, claiming that the exercises are dress rehearsals for impending invasion.In April, the US sent its Carl Vinson aircraft carrier towards the Korean Peninsula, saying it was taking prudent measures against the North. Pyongyang has vowed to "react to any mode of war." Intelligence officials estimate that North Korea could be less than two years away from striking the US. It seems increasingly les likely that US President Trump will allow that happen.Such a test would coincide with the country's biggest national celebrations, known as "Day of the Sun," on Saturday. Pyongyang has often used the date to mark a show of strength. In 2012, North Korea tried but failed to launch a long-range missile carrying a satellite, while last year it tested a barrage of newly developed intermediate-range missiles.The North has invited some 200 foreign journalists to Pyongyang ahead of the celebrations. So far, however, the only reports are of relatively low key events.China calls on North Korea to denuclearizeOn Thursday, China, North Korea's sole major ally and benefactor, urged the reclusive state to halt its nuclear program exchange for protection and security.An editorial in the influential state-backed Global Times newspaper said that denuclearization was the best option for North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un.Read more:&nbsp;Opinion: US, North Korea, China - diplomacy and saber rattling"As soon as North Korea complies with China's declared advice and suspends nuclear activities ...
