In the first quarter of 2017, Google parent Alphabetwas able to increase its profit by 29 percent jump to $5.4 billion, while revenue jumped 22 percent compared with a year ago to $24.75 billion."Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017," chief financial officer Ruth Porat said, adding that the company benefitted ongoing investments in product innovation which had injected "great momentum" in its businesses across the group.As in previous quarters, search engine Google delivered the overwhelming majority of revenues for the company with $24.5 billion. Alphabet's so-called "other bets," which include smart home devices, self-driving cars and life sciences, took in $244 million in revenue but delivered an operating loss of $855 million.The stronger-than-expected results helped lift Alphabet shares more than four percent in after-hours trade on Wall Street. However, the results did not appear to show a major impact of an ad boycott of Google's YouTube earlier this year after revelations that programmed ads were placed alongside videos showing hateful content.Porat told a conference call that "YouTube revenues continued to grow at a significant rate driven primarily by video advertising." Google has promised new efforts to match advertisers with appropriate content, using artificial intelligence, in response to complaints.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai cited "fantastic momentum" for a variety of products including its Google Assistant, the smart home device that competes with Amazon's Alexa-powered speakers. Pichai said the device is one element in a strategy focusing on artificial intelligence, or machine earning."Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better," he said.
