Egyptian President Abdel el-Sissi received a king's welcome when he landed in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Sunday to boost bilateral relations after months of tension.Saudi Arabia's King Salman greeted the Egyptian president when he stepped off the plane at the airport, before hosting him for lunch, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.Subsequently, the two leaders discussed a range of issues&nbsp; including "regional and international issues of common interest," according to the office of the Egyptian president.The statement, issued before the meeting, added that "the struggle against terrorism which threatens security and stability" in the region and beyond would top their agenda.

But it immediately provoked outrage in Egypt, and was subsequently blocked by a court ruling,signed during a visit by Salman to Cairo last year.But earlier this month, another Egyptian court ruling&nbsp;struck down the previous court's decision, describing it as invalid. Sissi claims the islands were Saudi territory and had been leased to Egypt in the 1950s.After el-Sissi toppled Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, when Sissi was head of the Egyptian army, Saudi Arabia supported Egypt with billions of dollars in aid.Riyadh opposes&nbsp;the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood to which Morsi belongs.Salman has reportedly accepted an invitation from Sissi to visit Egypt at the "earliest possible opportunity."bik/jlw&nbsp;(AFP, AP, dpa)
