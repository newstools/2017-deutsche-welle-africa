Following a meeting of the Defense Council on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault issued a statement to say the chemical agent responsible for the death of more than 80 people in the April 4 attack in Khan Sheikhoun in Syria was sarin."The sarin used April 4 is the same sarin that was used in an attack that took place in Saraqeb," also in Idlib province.Ayrault said that chemical analysis of samples taken from the site of the attack in Khan Sheikhoun&nbsp;implied "the use of sarin is without question," and that the "responsibility of President Bashar al-Assad's regime is also without question.""This method bears the signature of the regime and that is what allows us to establish its responsibility in this attack," the minister said.French investigators had confirmed with evidence&nbsp;from "safe sources" that the "manufacturing process of the sarin that was sampled is typical of the method developed in Syrian laboratories."President Assad denied responsibility for the attack on Khan Sheikhoun, claiming the allegations were "fabricated." Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under an agreement brokered by the US and Russia.US measuresThe US treasury earlier this week launched sanctions targeting employees of Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Center who had expertise in chemistry and related disciplines or had worked in support of the Syrian state program since 2012. The sanctions target any property&nbsp;individuals may have in the US in their own name or under the control of a US person. In January, 18 senior regime officials and branches of the Syrian military had been similarly sanctioned.This followed a US Tomahawk missile strike&nbsp;on the airfield from which the US claimed the chemical attack was launched.&nbsp;In April, US forces attacked a Syrian air base with cruise missiles in retaliation for a deadly chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians. The US attack killed several Syrian soldiers and almost completely destroyed the base.The air base Al-Shairat looked like this before 59 Tomahawk rockets were fired at the site. US President Donald Trump said this was the base from which the poison gas attack was flown out of on Tuesday. The strike aimed to destroy airplanes as well as prevent take-offs and landings.The cruise missiles were launched from the USS Porter and USS Ross warships stationed in the Mediterranean Sea. It was the first time US forces had directly attacked government forces in the six-year civil war. Previous attacks in Syria targeted the so-called "Islamic State."For Trump, the use of chemical weapons was a turning point in his attitude towards the Syrian conflict. After an even bigger chemical attack in August 2013, which killed several hundred people, he warned then-President Barack Obama against retaliating against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action," US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday, as she held up photographs of lifeless victims, including children.On Tuesday morning a residential district in Chan Sheikhun in Idlib province was bombed and poison gas was released. At least 70 people died in the attack, but responsibility is still unclear.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said "The United States is sending a strong message with this action that we will hold the entire Assad regime accountable for these blatant human rights violations in order to deter the spread of these types of barbaric chemical weapons."Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a security conference on Wednesday the missile attack was a pretext for regime change in Syria and that the US response "pushes the prospect for a wide international front on terror even further away."jm/rt (AP, dpa, AFP)
