Project goal: More veterinarians for Malawi (currently there are about 30 vets in the country) Funding: Around 6,000 euros ($6,400) per course (the seminar lasts 10 days) Project size: 15 students of veterinary medicine Animal protection is not on the top of the agenda in Malawi. The bitterly poor country has other concerns, as people there often lack the basics needed to survive. Livestock provides a living for many, but the country hasn't got enough vets, and innumerable animals die from treatable diseases and parasites. The WTG "Welttierschutzgesellschaft"&nbsp;is trying to improve the veterinarian education and practical training in Malawi, they&nbsp;train new veterinarians, and teach people how to better care for their animals. It's also sensitizing people to animal welfare and trying to improve living conditions for the animals. A film by J rgen Schneider
