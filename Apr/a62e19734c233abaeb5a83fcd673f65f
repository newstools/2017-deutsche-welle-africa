Many Greeks found the choice offensive.Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and his German colleague Frank-Walter SteinmeierHowever, according to local media, a change has come about in Athens, where there has been no money for cultural activities in recent years.Newspaper "Kathimerini" said on Saturday that hosting Documenta 14 also meant&nbsp;responsibility. "Can we meet this challenge at all?" asked the paper. "Nor organizationally - the Germans have taken care of that. But psychologically?""Now it is&nbsp;necessary to get rid of stereotypes, imaginary enemies&nbsp;and other obsessions," the paper added. "Documenta 14 offers enough time for that."Dimplomatic talksSteinmeier arrived in Athens on Friday on a two-day official visit to Greece during which also held talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.German-Greek relations have been strained on occasion in recent years, particularly over the austerity measures demanded of Athens in return for bailout loans that have averted a Greek bankruptcy.ksb/tj (AP, dpa)
