Sharapova's ban, for taking banned substance Meldonium,&nbsp;expires at midnight on Tuesday and she has been granted a wild card entry to the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart, where she will face&nbsp;Roberta Vinci in the opening round on Wednesday.With tennis ranking points accrued over a 12 month period, Sharapova currently has no world ranking, leading Vinci to suggest her opponent was receiving preferential treatment.&nbsp;"She is a great player and I have nothing against her. She paid&nbsp;for her mistakes," Vinci, 34, said on Monday. "She can return to play but&nbsp;without any wild cards, without any help."Sharapova was banned early in 2016The Russian player's suspension for using the heart drug meldonium after it was&nbsp;banned at the beginning of 2016, ends just in time to&nbsp;enter the opening round of the indoor clay tournament she won three&nbsp;times in a row from 2012-14.Vinci joined the likes of Caroline Wozniacki, Dominika Cibulkova,&nbsp;Agnieszka Radwanska, and Angelique Kerber -&nbsp;who has previously called the wild card "a little bit strange" -&nbsp;in speaking out against&nbsp;wild cards for players who return from a doping suspension."I know [Sharapova]&nbsp;is important for the tennis, for the WTA, for&nbsp;everything," Vinci said. "She is a great person, a great player, a&nbsp;great champion, but this is my opinion."Sharapova's comeback - and the storm over Ilie Nastase's recent comments - has somewhat overshadowed the tournament, which will feature eight of the world's top ten female players.mp/mf (AP/Reuters)
