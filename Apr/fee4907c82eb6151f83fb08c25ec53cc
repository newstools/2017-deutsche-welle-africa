Following days of political turmoil, Venezuela's opposition&nbsp;lawmakers demanded on Sunday the dismissal of the seven Supreme Court judges who issued a ruling&nbsp;stripping&nbsp;legislative power&nbsp;from the opposition-controlled National Assembly.Opposition leaders said the judges had to be removed to restore constitutional order in the economically embattled&nbsp;country.&nbsp;Congress doesn't, however, have the power to recall judges by itself."These judges cannot remain unpunished," Freddy Guevara, vice president of the National Assembly, said in Caracas.Government 'pacifying the public'The decision, which sparked huge protests, was reversed on Saturday after coming&nbsp;under heavy international criticism. Guevara slammed the Supreme Court's reversal, too, accusing the government&nbsp;of creating a purely cosmetic correction to cover up what he called a creeping coup d'etat.The goal of the court's decision to reverse the ruling was to pacify the public, Guevara said, adding that the government wanted to "deceive."
