Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet on Wednesday approved draft legislation that would foresee major fines for social media companies like Facebook and Twitter if they fail to delete hate speech, libel or other content in breach of German laws. Given the grand coalition government's monster majority in the lower house of parliament, approval there should be a formality.Ahead of Wednesday's decisive cabinet meeting to tackle internet hate speech, Justice Minister Heiko Maas reiterated his warning that online companies failing to delete criminal content themselves&nbsp;could face financial punishments&nbsp;of up to 50 million euros ($53 million)."We do not accept the fact that companies in Germany do not adhere to the law. Therefore in future, if it doesn't get better, we will impose high fines on these companies," the Social Democrat (SPD) told ARD breakfast show Morgenmagazin.A recent survey by the Justice Ministry showed that at just one&nbsp;percent, Twitter deletes&nbsp;"almost none" of the criminal content posted on its servers by users. Facebook meanwhile deletes around 50 percent and&nbsp;YouTube 90 percent.Responding on Morgenmagazin to Maas' comments, Green Party legal&nbsp;expert Renate K nast criticized that the proposed legislation ran&nbsp;the risk of limiting freedom of expression."My fear, and that of many others, is that in the end the version [Maas] is now presenting will&nbsp;limit freedom of opinion&nbsp;because it will simply become delete, delete, delete," she said."In principle,"&nbsp;Maas' approach isn't wrong, K nast added. However, in its current form, the draft law is "a rush job."&nbsp;The suggested high fine against non-compliant companies was "almost an invitation to not only delete real insults, but everything for safety's sake," K nast said.Accountability reportThe proposal by Maas on Wednesday is just the latest in a string of measures to combat hate speech on social media in Germany.The justice minister last month announced plans for a new law that will force social networks to publish a quarterly accountability report. The document will include information on the number and qualifications of employees responsible for deleting and blocking content that breaches Germany's hate speech and slander laws.German Justice Minister Heiko Maas launched a task force to crack down on "illegal hate speech on the internet" in 2015Social networks will also be obliged to offer users "an easily recognizable, directly reachable, and constantly available" complaint process for "prosecutable content," which includes&nbsp;libel, slander, defamation, incitement to commit a crime, hate speech against a particular social group, and threats.Landmark legislation in EuropeSome lawyers criticized the proposal, however, arguing that despite Maas' show of determination, the new bill gave little new substance to German law.W rzburg-based&nbsp;lawyer&nbsp;Holger Loos&nbsp;said it offered no new protections for personal rights. He argued that&nbsp;Anas Modamani,&nbsp;the Syrian who sued Facebook&nbsp;over the slanderous use of his photo on fake news stories, would have stood no better chance of winning under the new law.Should the bill be passed, however, Germany would be the first country in Europe to introduce such&nbsp;clear legal guidelines against online hate speech.
