In an appearance on state TV on Friday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the country's institutions were operating normally and that it was in fact&nbsp;his "right-wing, fascist" opponents who were attempting to break the constitutional order."In Venezuela, the constitution, civil, political and human rights and people power are in full force," Maduro said on Friday.The president's comments on Friday followed a decision by the Supreme Court two days earlier&nbsp;that saw the opposition-controlled congress stripped of its remaining legislative powers.Chief prosecutor opposes Supreme CourtIn a rare move, Venezuela's chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz rebuked the Supreme Court's decision. As&nbsp;the nation's top judicial authority, Diaz said it was her "unavoidable historical duty" to denounce what she described as a "rupture" of the constitutional order."We call for reflection, so that the democratic path can be&nbsp;retaken," she said, highlighting the strongest sign of division&nbsp;in the government since its standoff with the center-right opposition began in&nbsp;January last year.The statement from the long-time government loyalist came as a major boost to Venezuela's&nbsp;opposition, some of whom had spent the day sparring with riot police and gearing up for what they&nbsp;hope will be nationwide protests Saturday.Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said his "right-wing, fascist" opponents were attempting to break the constitutional orderMaduro responded to Ortega in his speech by vowing to resolve the impasse" between the attorney general and the court&nbsp;"through dialogue and the constitution."He also said he had called a meeting of security chiefs to "deliberate and draw up a resolution."Fears of dictatorshipThe Supreme Court's decision has also been met with&nbsp;a torrent of international condemnation over&nbsp;what many have decried as a major step toward dictatorship.&nbsp;"This clearly destroys the most important pillar of any democracy,&nbsp;which is popular representation," said President Juan&nbsp;Manuel Santos of neighboring Colombia. In the past, Santos has been reluctant to criticize&nbsp;Maduro, over fears of a backlash against the millions of Colombians who&nbsp;live in Venezuela and in recent months have been flocking home in the&nbsp;face of the worsening economic crisis.In the US, the Trump administration also strongly criticized the&nbsp;Supreme Court's move and called on Maduro to free political&nbsp;prisoners. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert urged the country to "return to democratic principles and the separation of powers."Anti-goverment protestsOpposing the ruling, scores of Maduro's opponents blocked a highway in the capital,&nbsp;Caracas, on Friday.The demonstrations were the start of what&nbsp;activists said will be rolling street protests against the ruling Socialists.Small groups of protesters blocked roads,&nbsp;unfurled banners and chanted slogans against Maduro's government, including "Freedom!" and "No to Dictatorship!"Weeks of unrest in 2014 left more than 40 people dead and dozens arrested,&nbsp;while a mass protest last September was followed a few days later by authorities canceling a recall petition campaign seeking to force&nbsp;Maduro from office before his term ends in 2019.ksb/jm (AFP, Reuters)
