Following a meeting of its rate-setting governing council on Thursday, the Frankfurt, Germany-based institution kept its main refinancing rate at 0.0 percent, the rate on the marginal lending facility at 0.25 percent, and thedeposit rate at minus 0.4 percent - meaning banks have to pay to park money with the central bank.It also left asset-buying program untouched under which it buys corporate and government bonds worth 60 billion euros ($65.3 billion)a month until December this year.The bank's interventions are designed to encourage banks to lend to the real economy, powering growth and pushing inflation towards its target of just below 2.0 percent.

That, he added, had resulted in a line being added to his introductory statement which noted that downside risks to the growth outlook "relate predominantly to global factors."Apparently, governors were anxious not to upset financial markets while eurozone heavyweight France navigates a high-stakes presidential election, which far-right anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen has a chance of winning.Now, the subtle tweak in language may be seen by ECB watchers as foreshadowing a more bold change at the next meeting in June, possibly including a removal of a phrase signaling a bias for more monetary policy easing.uhe/mds (Reuters, AFP)
