Barclays on Monday confirmed a probe into the lender and its Chief Executive Jes Staley linked to several attempts to find out the identity of a whistleblower within the British bank.It said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) had "commenced investigations into Staley as to his senior manager responsibilities relating to Barclays' whistle-blowing program.The board said it had accepted Staley's explanation that he didn't know he was not allowed to try and identify the author of a letter sent in 2016.It was forwarded to board members, raising concerns about a senior employee, who had recently been recruited, including issues of a personal nature, the bank explained. Staley had requested that the lender's Group Information Security (GIS) team find who wrote the letter, which he viewed as "an unfair personal attack."Not the first scandalBarclays vowed to cooperate fully with the FCA and PRA investigators, saying that "a very significant compensation adjustment" would be made to Staley's pay packet this year.
