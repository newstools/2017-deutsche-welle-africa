From France to Brazil, authorities have warned parents and educators of a challenge circulating on social media platforms called the "blue whale," allegedly a reference to a phenomenon in which the animal strands itself on land, typically leading to its death.The so-called game consists of a series of challenges provided by a so-called "curator," which include handing over personal information used to coerce participants into fulfilling tasks such as self-mutilation and taking one's life.The blue whale challenge garnered significant media attention after reports emerged that the game had been allegedly linked to scores of teenage suicides in Russia.In France, authorities called for "vigilance," warning that the game could attract vulnerable youth use in the process of building their identity in the face of pressure from the group."Do not let yourself be influenced. No challenge is worth risking your life," France's national police said in a tweet.'Blue whale' investigationsEarlier this week, Brazil's justice minister announced the launch of a federal investigation into links between a social media challenge called the "blue whale" and occurrences of bodily injury, self-mutilation and suicide among adolescents.Insults, rape and death threats: Even though the internet was supposed to be the great equalizer, hate speech online has led women to take a more passive role. In Germany, the search for solutions is on. In Brazil, Justice Minister Osmar Serraglio said he was prompted to request the investigation after local authorities from the states of Parana, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Maranhao and Amazonas reported the growing threat of the challenge in their respective territories.Authorities based their request on police records, accounts from victims' relatives and information provided by public health bodies and local governing councils. Local authorities have already launched investigations into three deaths with suspected links to the game, according to a ministry statement."We asked for the facts to be determined by the federal police and the game's organizers of be held accountable in Brazil," Serraglio said in a statement.While officials in Europe and elsewhere have yet to confirm a direct link between the game and cases of teenage suicide, internet phenomena such as the blue whale challenge have led to instances of violence.In 2014, two 12-year-old girls lured a fellow student into a forest in the US state of Wisconsin and stabbed her 19 times in an alleged bid to impress the fictional character Slender Man, created five years before for a Photoshop contest on an internet forum. At least one of the suspects said she acted out of fear that Slender Man would kill her family.

But its emergence and proliferation on social media provides a sobering reminder of the need to reinforce positive interactions for minors in an age when the internet has become ubiquitous.
