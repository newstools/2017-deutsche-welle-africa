Growing displacement in the region was also impacting neighboring east African countries like Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Yemen about 60 percent of the war-ravaged country's population is going hungry, amounting to 17 million people.Food insecurity is also growing in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region,&nbsp;particularly in the areas affected by the conflict with militant group Boko Haram. The UN counts about 7 million people at risk there.Aid pledges fall short of needDespite scaling up its operations, UNHCR has a funding shortfall. Its operations in South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen are funded at between 3 and 11 percent, Edwards said.Overall, the UN has appealed for $4.4 billion (4.15 billion euros) for the four countries but to date has received less than $984 million, Jens Laerke of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said."It is of immediate urgency that more funds are committed to avert a further descent into disaster in these acute crises," Laerke said.A high-level meeting called for by German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel was due to be held Wednesday in an attempt to raise more awareness for the dire humanitarian situation in the affected countries.se/kms (Reuters, AFP, AP) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2aCbI
