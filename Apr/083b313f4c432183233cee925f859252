The parliament in the Balkan country of Montenegro voted Friday to join the NATO military alliance despite strenuous objections from a vocal minority and from Russia.Forty-six of the country's 81 deputies voted to join the western alliance while opponents, including those in the parliament, protested outside.The vote took place in Cetinje, the historical capital about 30 miles (50 kilometers)&nbsp;from the current capital, Podgorica. Outside the vote, protesters voiced their displeasure and burned a NATO flag.But inside the assembly, Prime Minister Dusko Markovic told the parliamentary session "NATO membership will provide a safer and better life for all citizens in Montenegro."The Russian Foreign Ministry slammed the vote, saying it was conducted "under the pretext of an imaginary Russian threat."Russia has strong historical and cultural ties to Montenegro, a small Slavic state on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea.In a more ominous tone, the Kremlin added that those who voted in favor "are responsible for the consequences of materializing the plans of external powers aiming to deepen the existing lines of division in Europe and the Balkans," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website.Former Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic, once a close ally of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, called Friday "a sad day." Bulatovic told protesters: "I feel humiliated as this decision has been taken on my behalf."Montenegro's parliament ratifies NATO membership while opponents boycotted the voteNATO bombing campaignAntipathy towards NATO runs deep in some sectors of society still bitter about a 1999 bombing campaign.
