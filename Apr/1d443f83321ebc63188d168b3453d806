Canada's most populous province will soon join a growing list of places around the world that are exploring ways to give their citizens a guaranteed, basic income every month.Ontario will launch the basic income pilot later this spring in the Hamilton and Thunder areas, in south- and north-western Ontario, and in Lindsay, a town of about 20,000 residents around two hours east of Toronto, next fall.Adults between the ages of 18 and 64 living on a lower income in one of the three test locations will be chosen at random, and up to 4,000 people will receive monthly payments.A single person may receive up to $16,989 Canadian dollars (about 11,500 euros) annually, while a couple could get as much as $24,027 Canadian dollars.

The project will last for two years."The main goal here is to see how this kind of mechanism of basic income would increase the incentive to take on work," said Marjukka Turunen, head of the legal affairs unit at Kela, Finland's social security body, which administers the project.Turunen told DW it is too early to talk about results or analyze the data that has been collected to date.She said, however, that basic income "is not the one solution for every problem," but that the experiment may bring other solutions to the table, including ways Finland can ease the bureaucracy in its unemployment benefit system, or reform its social security framework.Turunen said Ontario should use its three-year project to gather as much information it can about what does and does not work in its own system."[Whether] this becomes a permanent mechanism in our system or not, we will have extremely useful information from it, and I think that [Ontario] will, too," she said.In the meantime, McGuire said the basic income pilot should not prevent Ontario from improving the system now by raising its social welfare rates, and not denying benefits to those who need them."I think we have to keep up our fight to raise the rates, [and] to improve the service," McGuire said. "There's still a lot of people suffering."
