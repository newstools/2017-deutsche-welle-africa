New legislature will also register the data of EU citizens, as well as anyone leaving the EU.European interior ministers first proposed the stricter measures after the terror attacks on Paris in November 2015.All 28 member states adopted the new legislature last month, as well as the four non-EU countries that are part of the Schengen agreement - Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.Keeping travel 'bearable'Countries that do not share a land border with nations outside of the Schengen area, such as Germany, will also be affected&nbsp;with the stricter checks being implemented at airports and ports, as well.German authorities have pledged to keep the affect on air traffic and waiting times "as bearable as possible, although travel agencies have warned of likely delays for travelers leaving and entering the EU.Nevertheless, the new legislature grants a degree of flexibility, allowing authorities to relax checks on land borders should the new rules lead to "disproportionate effects on traffic flows," German authorities said.Thousands of Europeans fighting for 'IS'According to a report released in December by the EU's top counter-terrorism coordinator Gilles De Kerchove, some 5,000 Europeans have travelled to the Middle East to fight alongside the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) since the jihadist group became one of the most forceful militant groups in the region in 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around one-third have since returned to Europe, according De Kerchove, while 15-20 percent are believed to have died and around half are thought to still be fighting in the Middle East.dm/kl&nbsp;(AFP, dpa) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/1HkUA
