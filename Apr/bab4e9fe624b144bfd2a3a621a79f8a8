A breakthrough was&nbsp;achieved in the talks between Greece and the eurozone finance ministers on Friday, which will ensure the southern eurozone nation will have enough money to meet a deadline for debt repayments.Greece is awaiting the latest tranche of an 86-billion-euro ($91.6-billion) bailout from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone's rescue fund, that it needs for debt repayments in July.Talks between Athens and its creditors had stalled over the last few months with calls for the Greek government to make additional pension cuts, continue to deregulate&nbsp;the labor market and reduce the tax-exemption ceiling.The IMF had&nbsp;lobbied for austerity measures on Greece to be eased, but other creditors in Europe had disagreed, calling for 3.6 billion euros' worth of further austerity measures.Ray of hopeEarlier this week, Greek president Alexis Tsipras demanded a meeting of the eurozone nations if there was no breakthrough at the meeting on Friday.
