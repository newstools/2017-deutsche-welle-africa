In Berlin for the Women20 Germany&nbsp;- a two-day&nbsp;summit on women's empowerment as part of the G20 process - Ivanka Trump missed her opportunity&nbsp;on a global stage to clearly articulate an agenda of any kind on women's rights.The US president's daughter told the Berlin&nbsp;audience that&nbsp;she has always known her father as someone who has fought for women's rights. The audience&nbsp;erupted in giggles and boos, but she took no notice.Ivanka went&nbsp;on to say that&nbsp;her father has always supported her and "thousands of women working for him" at some stage in the past. Those listening&nbsp;expressed their confusion and disagreement, but she kept&nbsp;showing a poker face.It's obvious that her mission in Berlin is to try to&nbsp;polish up her father's image. That's why she's the "First Daughter" and his adviser. Of course, Trump fille&nbsp;is&nbsp;also an entrepreneur, but it is&nbsp;not in this capacity that she is&nbsp;participating in the Berlin panel on strengthening female entrepreneurship. She is here simply by virtue of being the president's daughter.DW editor Vanessa FischerIvanka holds little credibility&nbsp;as an ambassador for gender equality issues. Too obvious are her attempts to forge new alliances and rally support for the president's economic agenda. Yes, she's a successful entrepreneur, but it took&nbsp;her father's fame and fortune&nbsp;to&nbsp;pave&nbsp;the way for her&nbsp;business success.There's no shame in that per se, but it is at&nbsp;least worth noting as the Women 20 congress debates the plight of millions of women&nbsp;who have no access to banks and creditors and are therefore severely hampered in becoming entrepreneurs. These are&nbsp;the real-world&nbsp;problems&nbsp;women in India, Kenya,&nbsp;Argentina - to name but a few -&nbsp;face every day. They report that they have to use their fathers or brothers as middlemen to even get a potential business partner on the phone. Those are problems that Ivanka Trump surely doesn't have to grapple with and for which she shows&nbsp;little awareness or&nbsp;concern.What&nbsp;she's done&nbsp;in Berlin instead is provide&nbsp;some very vague and extremely&nbsp;shallow comments on gender inequality. Moreover,&nbsp;she's all too glad to drop her father's name as often as possible, inexplicably portraying him as a feminist and staunch advocate of equality between the sexes.Sadly, Ivanka Trump's empty statements in Berlin are a huge missed opportunity to have a substantive discussion of issues that affect women - and therefore the world as a whole.Have something to say?
