The much-heralded rallies began with opposing camps gathering on the streets of the capital, Caracas, and other cities throughout Venezuela. Wednesday is a holiday marking the declaration of independence from Spain 200 years ago.The rallies are the latest in a series of opposition protests&nbsp;gathering support around a number of issues. They range from a decision three weeks ago by the government-stacked Supreme Court to strip the opposition-controlled Congress of its last remaining powers after a year-long battle, to the dwindling supply of medicines and basic supplies, food shortages, triple-digit inflation and rampant crime.Demonstrators dressed to oppose, and support President MaduroThe protesters converged from 26 different points spread across the capital in an attempt to march downtown to the Caracas office of the ombudsman, who is responsible for investigating complaints against any public authority. Previous marches attempting the same route have been met with security vehicles, tear gas and rubber bullets fired by riot police officers.&nbsp;Gun shotsDue to media constraints imposed by government controls it is not possible to verify some of the reports via social media of attacks on protesters. But a hospital director has confirmed the death of an 18-year-old student, Carlos Moreno, who was on his way to play soccer when shots were fired near groups of opposition and government supporters.&nbsp;Authorities in the city of San Cristobal also reported that a 23-year-old woman was killed by gunfire after pro-government supporters circled protesters. No further details were immediately available.Five other people have been killed since protests broke out earlier this month following the Supreme Court's decision to strip Congress of its powers. &nbsp;According to the Venezuelan Criminal Forum, cited by rights group Amnesty International, more than 100 people remain in detention in Venezuela for political reasons.Political timelineThe opposition has called for a timeline leading to delayed elections. They were backed by 11 Latin American countries who issued a joint statement this week calling on authorities to set a time frame for elections to "allow for a quick solution to the crisis that Venezuela is living through."Opposition protesters gathered along Francisco Fajardo highway in CaracasIn the statement, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay rejected the violence in Venezuela&nbsp;which led to the deaths of protesters.Plan Zamora to resist 'coup'In a televised statement made when he was seated with his government ministers on Tuesday evening, President Nicolas Maduro accused the US State Department of trying to promote a military intervention and "direct aggression."The president signed orders late Tuesday activating the "green phase" of military plans to defend the South American country against what he described as US-backed attempts to sow chaos and overthrow him. He said authorities had rounded up "conspirators."The day before, in&nbsp;a US State Department statement titled "Non Violence and Accountability During Protests in Venezuela," the US&nbsp; government encouraged "demonstrators to express themselves non-violently." It also reminded the Venezuela security forces "of their legal and constitutional responsibilities to protect, not prevent, peaceful demonstrations."Maduro said he was expanding civilian militias created by his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, and giving each member a gun.Venezuela's economic woes are set to continue, according to the World Bank, which has forecast that the rate of economic growth in the country would be negative 3.1 percent in 2017. It was minus 12 percent in 2016. The bank forecast 0.6 percent growth for next year on the back of projected firmer oil prices - far below estimates for regional growth of about 2.5 percent for 2018.&nbsp;Venezuela has, according to some estimates, the world's largest oil reserves. However oil industry management has been criticized as ineffectual, with inadequate and outdated equipment.jm, dm/cmk (EFE, AP)
