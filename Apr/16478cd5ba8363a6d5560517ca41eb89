The office of Bashar al-Assad also slammed the strike as "rash" and "shortsighted."11:15&nbsp;Vladimir Putin and Russia's top security officials were "deeply concerned" about the consequences of the US strike, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after an urgent meeting in Moscow."They have also expressed regret about the damage done to the bilateral ties between Russia and the US," he said.11:03 Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif slammed the US for "fighting on the same side" as al Qaeda and the "Islamic State" in a series of tweets.&nbsp;11:01 Russian Defense Ministry believes that the US missile strike was being prepared long before the alleged chemical attack in Idlib.

"This question must be taken to the UN Security Council, which has to take responsibility for a lasting political solution."10:41&nbsp;The US informed the EU that "these strikes were limited,"&nbsp;EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said.10:30 Ukrainian Foreign Ministry supported&nbsp;the US military action in Syria."For those who break who break international law by using chemical weapons, impunity would lead to further crimes The backers and those who cover up the crimes of the Syrian regime are also responsible for using the weapons of mass destruction and civilians casualties," Kyiv said.10:23 French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault says that Paris urged Russia to negotiate."We have to stop the hypocrisy. If Russia is acting in good faith it should stop and negotiate," he said. "We do not wish to raise the stakes, but to find a solution. You can not deal with reality (use of chemical weapons) by resorting to propaganda."10:20 The US attack killed nine civilians, including four children, according to the Syrian state news agency SANA.10:16 NATO head Jens Stoltenberg said that Syrian authorities carried the blame for the missile strike."Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, cannot go unanswered, and those responsible must be held accountable," he added.10:13&nbsp;With the international community divided on the US strike in Syria, there is a risk of the shockwaves spreading far beyond Syrian borders, says DW's Lewis Sanders.Read: US polarizes world with attack on Syrian regime10:12 An unidentified warplane bombed the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, the site of the earlier chemical weapons attack, on Friday, according to the&nbsp; Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.10:10 Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad."This regime must be removed from leading Syria as soon as possible and the best way to do that is by starting the transitional process," Cavusoglu said in televised remarks.10:08 Russia's President Vladimir Putin will hold a meeting of his security council later on Friday.

The United States has clearly indicated that (Syrian President Bashar) Assad's atrocities do not go unpunished."09:35 The key rival of chancellor Merkel in the upcoming parliementary elections Germany, SPD chief Martin Schulz, urged Europe to put in more effort into resolving the Syrian crisis."For far too long, we the Europeans have only looked at the US and Russia," he said. The EU needs to take more "political, not&nbsp;military" responsibility, he added.09:25&nbsp;EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted&nbsp;that the strike showed US "resolve."09:13 The US says that the targeted army compound served as a base to launch the chemical weapons attack that killed at least 80 people.On Friday morning, US forces attacked a Syrian air base with cruise missiles in retaliation for a deadly chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians. The US attack killed several Syrian soldiers and almost completely destroyed the base.The air base Al-Shairat looked like this before 59 Tomahawk rockets were fired at the site. US President Donald Trump said this was the base from which the poison gas attack was flown out of on Tuesday. The strike aimed to destroy airplanes as well as prevent take-offs and landings.The cruise missiles were launched from the USS Porter and USS Ross warships stationed in the Mediterranean Sea. It was the first time US forces had directly attacked government forces in the six-year civil war. Previous attacks in Syria targeted the so-called "Islamic State."For Trump, the use of chemical weapons was a turning point in his attitude towards the Syrian conflict. After an even bigger chemical attack in August 2013, which killed several hundred people, he warned then-President Barack Obama against retaliating against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action," US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday, as she held up photographs of lifeless victims, including children.On Tuesday morning a residential district in Chan Sheikhun in Idlib province was bombed and poison gas was released.

"The international community was shocked by the tragedy that left many young children among the victims."07:08 The UK says that the strike was designed to deter the regime from any new chemical weapons attacks."We've not been asked to be involved in this, this was not a matter for the coalition that's in Syria and Iraq fighting [the Islamic State militia]," Fallon said.

DW has the overview of the&nbsp;many fractions and world powers engaged in the long and complicated war.Syria's army, officially known as the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) suffered mass defections in the fall of 2011 to what would become the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army. The SAA is assisted by a number of pro-Assad militias such as the National Defense Force.The Free Syrian Army grew out of protests against the Assad regime that eventually turned violent. Along with other non-jihadist rebel groups, it seeks the ouster of President Assad and democratic elections. After suffering a number of defeats, many of its members defected to terrorist groups. It garnered some support from the US and Turkey, but its strength has been greatly diminished.Taking advantage of the chaos, "Islamic State" (IS) terrorists captured vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. Seeking to establish its own "caliphate," IS has become infamous for its militant and fundamentalist brand of Islam as well as for the mass murder and torture carried out under its black flag. It established a stronghold in the Syrian city of Raqqa (pictured above).IS is not the only terrorist group that holds sway in Syria. A number of Islamist militant groups, such as the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front, also known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, are fighting in the conflict. Warring with each other and well as with Assad and moderate rebels, al-Nusra Front merged with several other entities under the umbrella name Tahrir al-Sham in January 2017.The Kremlin has proven to be a powerful friend to President Assad. Russian ground troops officially joined the fight in September 2015 after years of suppyling the Syrian army. Moscow has come under fired from the international community for the high number of civilian casualties during its airstrikes.After denouncing Assad and tacitly supporting moderate rebels, the US and other NATO countries declined to send ground troops to assist in the Syrian conflict. However, a US-led coalition of about 60 countries, including Germany, began targeting IS and other terrorist targets with airstrikes in late 2014.In April the US launched a missile strike against a Syrian air-base in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians. The attacked marked a sharp turn-around in US Syrian policy, with President Donald Trump long advocating against direct action against the Syrian regime.Syria's neighbors have been dragged into the conflict in the interests of their own border security. Turkey, which is also part of the US-led coalition against IS, has actively supported moderate rebels opposed to Assad. It has a tense relationship with its American allies, however, over US cooperation with Kurdish fighters, some of whom support Kurdish secessionist factions within Turkey.Fighting between Syrian Kurds and Islamists in the north and west of Syria has become its own conflict. An ethnic group concentrated in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, Kurds have long sought their own homeland or autonomy within their respective countries. Turkey considers armed Kurdish fighters within its borders to be terrorists. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have also be assisting the US-led coalition.The involvement of Iran illustrates how much the Syrian conflict has become a proxy war for tensions between Iran and Russia on one side, and Turkey and the US on the other. Iran relies on Syria's friendship to maintain the balance of power in the region. Tehran has assisted Damascus with strategic assistance, military training, and ground troops.Six years on, Syria is still divided between numerous belligerents. Many rounds of UN-brokered peace talks have failed to deliver any substantive peace deal.
