German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Wednesday called on Beijing to open up its markets to foreign companies and guarantee fairer business conditions for German companies in the doing business in China.After meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Berlin, Gabriel said the two countries were on the right track in fostering a partnership based on fair conditions for firms from both German and China."There's work that still remains to be done, but there's no question&nbsp;that it is a common goal," Gabriel said.&nbsp;Read:&nbsp;Survey shows German firms 'less welcome' in China Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/18NwIGabriel made no secret that Germany's push for better relations with China comes on the back of increasingly isolation policies in the United States under President Donald Trump."Of course, when we see one part of the world choosing to shut itself off and adopt protectionist measures, it's clear that we have to look for new and improved partnerships," Gabriel told reporters. "That's not to say that we want to annul our old partnerships. Quite the opposite: We are in favor of free and open trade with the United States."Read:&nbsp;Germany criticizes Trump executive orders on tradeGabriel's diplomatic recordGabriel has a mixed record when it comes to dealing with China. Since becoming foreign minister in January, he has pushed a realignment in Germany's relationship with China.However, last year, while he served as economy minister, Gabriel led a large business delegation on a largely unsuccessful five-day visit to China where he accused the Chinese government of unfairly treating German companies operating the country. Gabriel's allegedly standoffish attitude also prompted Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng to cancel a meeting with him. Berlin's "anti-investment mood" had prompted Gao to cancel the meeting, his deputy said.North Korea overshadows talksGabriel and Wang's meeting Wednesday was overshadowed by the deployment of a US missile defense in South Korea, built in response to Pyongyang's ballistic missile program.China has said it strongly opposes to the deployment, sanctioning South Korean firms in response. It called for calm on the Korean peninsula as a&nbsp;US carrier group was sent to the region China calls for US restraint on North Korea .Gabriel said he was grateful that China was taking its role and key intermediary seriously as tensions heighten between North Korea and its regional enemies, plus the US. However, the United States had also sent "clear signals that it wants to de-escalate the situation," he said.
