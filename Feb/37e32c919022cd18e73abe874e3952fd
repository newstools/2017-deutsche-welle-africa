The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin was&nbsp;grieving after learning of Churkin's&nbsp;death."The head of state highly valued Churkin's professionalism and&nbsp;diplomatic talent," Peskov said, adding that the president had expressed his condolences to Churkin's loved ones.Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the UN&nbsp;secretary general's office, said: "He has been such a regular&nbsp;presence here that I am actually quite stunned. Our thoughts go&nbsp;to his family, to his friends and to his government."&nbsp;Meanwhile, the UK Mission&nbsp;to the United Nations tweeted: "Vitaly Churkin was a pillar of the [UN Security Council]&nbsp;for over a decade. Our deepest condolences to his family [and]&nbsp;colleagues..."Churkin was a pugnacious defender of Russian policy, most notably&nbsp;its intensive bombing of the Syrian city of Aleppo last year to crush rebels opposing Syrian&nbsp;President Bashar al-Assad.When then-US&nbsp;envoy to the UN&nbsp;Samantha Power accused&nbsp;Syria, Russia and Iran last year of bearing responsibility for&nbsp;atrocities there, Churkin said she was acting like Mother Teresa&nbsp;and forgetting her own country's track record in the Middle&nbsp;East.On hearing of her counterpart's death,&nbsp;Power&nbsp;said was "devastated," describing Churkin as a "diplomatic maestro." He was a "deeply caring man" who tried to&nbsp;bridge differences between the US and Russia, she added.Power's successor Nikki Haley -&nbsp;who took up the post last month -&nbsp;also&nbsp;offered&nbsp;her condolences, saying that Churkin "showed himself to be a gracious&nbsp;colleague.""We did not always see things the same way," she added. "But he unquestionably advocated his country's positions with great skill."ksb/msh (dpa, AFP, Reuters)
