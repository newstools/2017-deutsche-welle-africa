"This is not a joke," he then had to repeat it twice, holding up the right card to the cameras.Warren Beatty then stepped up to the microphone to explain what happened: "I opened the envelope and it said 'Emma Stone, La La Land.' That's why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny!""Even in my dreams this cannot be true," said director Barry Jenkins when he unexpectedly picked up the statuette for his low-budget coming-of-age drama.Envelope handed out twiceShortly before, Emma Stone had received the best actress in a leading role award.
