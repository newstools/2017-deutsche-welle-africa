"MEGA": Make Europe Great Again. Recreating the iconic "Hope" posters from Barack Obama's 2008 US presidential campaign, not to mention riffing on Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan,&nbsp;the poster (pictured above) is just one of many memes to bear the face of Social Democrat (SPD) Martin Schulz in recent weeks.Ever since announcing last month that the former president of the European Parliament was to&nbsp;run against Merkel in September's parliamentary elections, the Social Democrats have enjoyed a huge boost in opinion polls. A poll released Friday&nbsp;by the German broadcaster ZDF saw the SPD climb six&nbsp;percentage points to 30 -&nbsp;leaving them four behind Merkel's Union, which fell by two&nbsp;percent.And now, riding the wave of popularity, Schulz has taken on a different guise thanks to a group of ardent Schulz enthusiasts on&nbsp;the semi-satirical&nbsp;subreddit "r/The_Schulz." From Robin Hood to Jesus, Schulz has been making apperances as all manner of famous figures, not least as the Prince from Germany's&nbsp;much-loved Prinzen Rolle cookies that&nbsp;originally came from Belgium - much like Schulz who returned to Berlin from&nbsp;from Brussels.Another post that uses&nbsp;popular meme material from the music video to Drake's 2015 hit single "Hotline Bling" simply states: "Me, during the election." In a parody of the 1994 thriller "Speed," another meme (below) reads:&nbsp;"No Breaks. Next Stop: Chancellery"Many of the memes on reddit were posted by Twitter user @keineBremsen (No brakes).One reads: "Guaranteed to not make any secret Russian agreements ... can speak namely only French, English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Italian."Some go&nbsp;back to basics, taking&nbsp;a swipe at the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germay (AfD) as Schulz drinks from a cup labelled "AfD tears."Reddit users&nbsp;going by the name of "Schulzenbrothers" have gone so far as to create the&nbsp;"Schulzzuglied" (Schulz train song), which has already garnered almost 150,000 hits."Good luck! Good luck!" sing the anonymous users. "The Schulz train is rolling! And he has no breaks, travels at full speed into the chancellery, into the chancellery."'Half-serious satire'&nbsp;Inspired by "r/the Donald" subreddit, which&nbsp;spawned a plethora of memes for US President Donald Trump during his 2016 election campaign, "r/The_Schulz" has slowly been picking up momentum since Trump entered the Oval Office.However, where "r/the_Schulz" is being sold as a "half-serious satire" of "r/the_Donald," the subreddit for Trump soon turned into a stomping ground home for homophobic, nationalistic and racist slogans.&nbsp;'Jump on the Schulz train'But the satirical allusions to "r/the_Donald" are clear, with references to the "God Emperor," "high energy" - a phrase which was coined by Trump himself" after dubbing internal opponent Jeb Bush as "low energy"&nbsp;- and even a spin on the "Trump&nbsp;Train."Schulz himself has already thanked reddit users for their support, describing&nbsp;the page as "a massive help" to him."Thank you for the enthusiasm," Schulz said, adding that the thread was "engaging, creative and thoroughly enjoyable."
