Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton said Tuesday it logged a dramatic surge in half-year profits on the back of higher raw materials prices.Underlying profit (excluding one-off effects and other infrequent factors) of $3.2 billion (3.03 billion euros) and earnings before tax of $9.9 billion for the final six months of 2016 exceeded analysts' expectations.The results marked a 157-percent increase in underlying profit from a year ago and a 65-percent year-on-year jump in operating earnings (pre-tax profit).
