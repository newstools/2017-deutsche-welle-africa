Near the stroke of midnight, five NATO defense ministers gathered at the Munich Security Conference to discuss whether in US President Donald Trump's&nbsp;words the transatlantic alliance was "obsolete."First to speak, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon&nbsp;answered simply, but with robust clarity."The only answer to the question is: NATO is very important in 2017. But to remain important, NATO must act faster," Fallon said. "The alliance needs to be ready to project stability beyond its borders."In the wake of Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, NATO member states committed to bolstering the alliance's eastern flank, deploying battalions in a defense posture known as enhanced forward presence.The move came under sharp criticism from Moscow, which claims&nbsp;it represents a provocative maneuver that posed a threat on Russia's borders.However, Fallon did not mince his words when describing the Kremlin's strategies to undermine democracies on its periphery, in part as a response to Trump's often-provocative remarks.Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev arrives at the 52nd Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, February 13, 2016"It's Putin, not Trump, who's deploying those missiles. It's Putin, not Trump, who's interfering in foreign democracies," Fallon said.
