Saudi Arabia's chief foreign affairs diplomat Adel al-Jubeir (photo) met with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad Saturday - marking the first time a Saudi foreign minister had visited the Iraqi capital since 1990.Jubeir met his counterpart Ibrahim al-Jaafari and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, and told them that the Saudi kingdom would be appointing a new ambassador to Baghdad."This visit is to reestablish relations in a more stable way than previously," a senior Saudi government official said. "It's the first visit of its kind."Last year the Iraqi government asked Riyadh to replace its ambassador Thamer al-Sabhan after his comments about Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs, including the alleged persecution of Sunni Muslims. His comments angered local Shiite&nbsp;politicians and militia leaders.Sabhan was the first Saudi ambassador to Iraq after it reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 following a 25-year break - after Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait. He was appointed in January 2016 but Baghdad demanded his removal just eight months later.Close ties to Iran Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/1F2AORiyadh has long accused Iraq of being too close to Shiite Iran, its main regional rival, and of encouraging sectarian discrimination against Sunnis; charges Baghdad denies.Sectarian conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq have increased tensions between Sunni and Shiite regional powers in recent years.Iraq, which back in the 1980s was embroiled in a vicious war with neighboring Iran, is now seen as an&nbsp;ally of the self-styled Islamic republic - and a regional rival to Saudi Arabia.Al-Jubeir discussed enhancing bilateral ties&nbsp;with Prime Minister al-Abadi, according to a statement from al-Abadi's office said.The Saudi diplomat also expressed his country's support for an ongoing US-backed Iraqi campaign aimed at dislodging militants with so-called "Islamic State" (IS)&nbsp;from Iraq, the statement said without providing further details.bik/jm (Reuters, AFP, dpa)
