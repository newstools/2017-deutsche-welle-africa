A regional court in Seoul on Friday officially declared Hanjin Shipping bankrupt, ushering in the final chapter for the South Korean shipping company, which had struggled for years under the weight of billions of dollars worth of debt.Hanjin filed for bankruptcy protection in August of last year, owing $5.37 billion (5.03 billion euros) as creditors refused to bail it out.As a result, dozens of vessels were left stranded around the world as they were refused entry to ports. An accounting firm hired by the Seoul court concluded earlier this year that the firm's liquidation value would be greater than its worth as a going concern.Slumping trade and mismanagementHanjin was once South Korea's biggest shipping company and the seventh-largest in the world. It has since been forced to sell most of its assets at home and abroad to pay off debts, with more than 1,500 employees laid off in the process.
