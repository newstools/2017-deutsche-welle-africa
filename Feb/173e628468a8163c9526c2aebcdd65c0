This week, we re presenting five artists who work with paper, creating pop-up cards, elaborate sculptures, 3D invitations or even entire landscapes from old books for example. You must have experimented with paper art when you were a child making boats, airplanes or perhaps even a crane.&nbsp; But have you ever tried folding a sheet of A4 paper as many times as possible? Try it or take a guess! What do you think?4 or 5 times?&nbsp; 6 or 7 times?&nbsp; 14 or 15 times?&nbsp; If you send us your answer, you can win a pop-up card designed by the German artist Peter Dahmen. The submission date is 3 March 2017, 12:00 UTC. All decisions are final.&nbsp; Best of luck!!
