Schalke brought a healthy 3-0 lead from last week s first leg to Gelsenkirchen, and Markus Weinzierl s side never relinquished control of the tie in front their home fans.PAOK s vocal support travelled in big numbers to the Ruhr region of western Germany, but the visitors were unable to make a great impression on the field.Schalke took the lead through Alessandro Sch pf, who slotted the ball under PAOK goalkeeper Panagiotis Glykos for his third goal in five games after Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting crafted the opening with a neat touch and assist.But PAOK responded almost immediately. Ioannis Mystakidis whipped in a dangerous shot from the left and the outstretched Matija Nastasic, under pressure to clear, diverted the ball into his own net.Klaas-Jan Huntelaar came close to notching a second for Schalke when he leaped high in the box, but could only put his header wide when he should have at least tested Glykos. Substitute Thilo Kehrer also went close in the second half when his shot was cleared off the line.But it mattered little for Schalke, whose excellent display in Greece last week did the damage for PAOK, and the Bundesliga side progress comfortably to the last 16.&nbsp;Other Europa League results:St Etienne 0-1 Manchester United (0-4 agg.)Fenerbahce 1-1 Krasnodar (1-2 agg.)&nbsp;Schalke 1-1 PAOK - as it happened:
