Wolfsburg have fired Valerien Ismael and will present a new head coach on Monday.&nbsp;The 41-year-old Frenchman, who took over in &nbsp;November, was Wolfsburg's eighth head coach since 2010 and has lasted only 13 matches at the helm. The Wolves languish 14th in the Bundesliga, having lost four of their last five games."After weighing up all the facts and circumstances, we agreed that separation is the right way to get the team back on the track. In the decision-making process, we weren't&nbsp;guided primarily by the most recent result against Werder Bremen, but also included the impressions and results from the last weeks and months," said sporting director Olaf Rebbe in a club statement.According to a report from German news agency DPA, Rebbe was close to changing coach twice, but Ismael's men picked up some important wins against Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia M nchengladbach."It's about results, and they just do not fit. We must evaluate how we can successfully improve the next few weeks," said Rebbe after Friday's 2-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen.The Frenchman was previously head coach of Wolfsburg's second team, but was promoted quickly to the first-team following the decision to release Dieter Hecking in October.rd/mds (DPA)
