Kim Jong Nam's assassination in the Malaysian capital on February 13 has snowballed into a major diplomatic spat between Kuala Lumpur and Pyongyang.Malaysian authorities investigating the crime on Wednesday sought permission to question a high-ranking official of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Second Secretary Hyon Kwang Song, in connection with the incident. They also added a North Korean airline employee to the list of suspects."We have written to the ambassador to allow us to interview both of them. We hope that the Korean embassy will cooperate with us and allow us to interview them quickly. If not, we will compel them to come to us," Malaysia's top policeman Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters.Kim appeared to have been poisoned at Kuala Lumpur's international airport and leaked CCTV footage from the airport shows the 45-year-old being approached by two women, one of whom grabs him from behind and appears to shove a cloth in his face.Malaysian police say he suffered a seizure and died before he reached the hospital, seemingly from the effects of a toxin. They have so far arrested four people, including the two women who were allegedly seen approaching Kim.

A week on, the body of dictator Kim Jong Un's half-brother has yet to be claimed by a relative. (21.02.2017) The Kuala Lumpur government is angry over claims it has something to hide in its probe into the death of Kim Jong Un's half-brother. This comes as video footage emerges apparently showing the incident. (20.02.2017) The North Korea official is suspected of involvement in the murder of Kim Jong Nam who was killed at the airport in Malaysia. Police have accused North Korea of ordering the assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother. (22.02.2017) "The trouble is that the North Korean ambassador needs to keep making these unhinged statements -&nbsp;that's the only way that's acceptable to his superiors in Pyongyang," said&nbsp;Shahriman Lockman, a senior analyst at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia (ISIS), a think tank.&nbsp;"While I certainly don't expect the relationship to be severed, a form of downgrade looks inevitable at this stage," he added.Close tiesSuch deterioration would be a major setback for North Korea. That's because since Malaysia established diplomatic ties with North Korea in 1973, Kuala Lumpur has maintained a close partnership with the reclusive regime in Pyongyang.Malaysia's importance in the international community's dealings with Pyongyang can be observed in the fact that it often discreetly hosts diplomatic talks between US and North Korean officials on the regime's controversial nuclear program.The two nations also accord reciprocal visa-free travel to each other's citizens, and a small community of North Korean expats in Malaysia is said to be engaged in business and money-making schemes for the Pyongyang regime hit hard by crippling UN sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship gave the North Koreans a modicum of diplomatic space and a place where they can gain some foreign currency," Lockman told DW.&nbsp;"Nonetheless, most Malaysians are surprised that there's even a North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The North Koreans certainly need us more than we would ever need them," he stressed, pointing out that annual trade between the two sides account for a mere 0.002 percent of Malaysia's total external commerce.What next?But what measures can Malaysia take in case North Korea refused to cooperate with the authorities investigating Kim's murder there?The chances of Malaysian police questioning embassy official Hyon Kwang Song appear almost nil as he enjoys diplomatic immunity, say experts.&nbsp; Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2XsiXFurthermore, Lockman underlines, if the Air Koryo employee is inside the embassy now, the police would have difficulties questioning him as diplomatic premises are inviolable under the Vienna Convention. "I would be surprised if the police would ever get to talk to these individuals," he noted.Zachary Abuza, a Southeast Asia security expert and professor at the Washington-based National War College, said&nbsp;Malaysian leverage in this instance is economic."I have no doubt that North Korea uses the Malaysian banking sector as one of its few international financial gateways for settling trade," he told DW, adding that it is also a key source of electronics and other goods that the Pyongyang regime imports. "While the overall trade levels are paltry, especially for Malaysia, they are important for North Korea."In this context, the analyst points out that Malaysia could start to investigate North Korean businesses for financial improprieties, or limit the number of Koreans who have residence cards. "They could also abrogate their agreement on visa-free travel."At this stage, most Malaysians are just astounded, says analyst Lockman. "But that initial shock is now gradually turning into anger after the North Korean ambassador's statements."He points out that the youth wing of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) - the main party in the ruling coalition - is planning a demonstration in front of the North Korean embassy on Thursday, February 23."Few Malaysians have any stake in the relationship, so there's unlikely to be any sympathy for the North Koreans."High-profile defector Hwang Jang-Yop survived numerous assassination attempts before dying of natural causes at the age of 87. Hwang, who had been one of the leading ideologues of the North's isolationist regime, escaped to South Korea in 1997. Just months before his death in 2010, Seoul authorities arrested two North Korean military officers over one of many plots to kill him.The execution of Kim Jong-Un's uncle Jang Song Thaek, once the second most powerful man in the isolated country, sent shockwaves beyond North Korea's borders. Many media outlets wrongly reported that he was fed to hungry dogs, as punishment for his "betrayal" of the ruling family. In reality, he was shot, according to Pyongyang officials and South Korean intelligence.In 2015, Seoul's security services reported that North Korean Defense Minister Hyon Yong-chol was executed by an anti-aircraft gun. However, National Intelligence Service (NIS) soon appeared to backtrack from the report, saying that Hyon might still be alive. Reports of other brutal executions, involving artillery shells and flamethrowers, have also been difficult to confirm.North Korean defector and well-known dissident Park Sang-hak was also targeted by a Pyongyang-linked hitman. In 2011, South Korean authorities arrested a former North Korean commando over the plot to assassinate Park Sang-hak with a poison-tipped needle.The estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un was reportedly poisoned by two women at a Kuala Lumpur airport. While details remain sketchy, it is widely believed that the killers were sent by the North Korean regime. The 46-year-old Kim Jong-Nam had been living abroad after falling from grace in 2001 for visiting Disneyland in Tokyo.&nbsp;
