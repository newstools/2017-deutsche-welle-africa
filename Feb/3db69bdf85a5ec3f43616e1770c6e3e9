Gambian President Adama Barrow on Monday sacked the head of the army and dismissed several other officers, as the new leader seeks to clear out former security officials from his predecessor Yahya Jammeh's iron-fisted government.General Ousman Badjie was replaced by Barrow's military advisor Massaneh Kinteh. Ten other senior officers, including the directors of operations and intelligence, were also removed, army spokesman Lieutenant Kemo Kanuteh said.Barrow is&nbsp;trying to assert control&nbsp;following the end of Jammeh's 22-year rule. The former president fled the country last month after West African regional powers intervened to force him to accept Barrow's December election victory.Badjie's loyalty was under question as he appeared to sit on the fence during the crisis, pledging allegiance along with other top officials on January 20, a day before Jammeh fled. He will now be posted to a foreign mission, a military official said.The new president has pledged to investigate human rights abuses during Jammeh's reign, expand freedoms and release prisoners being held without trial. The United Nations and human rights groups accused Gambia's security forces under Jammeh of multiple abuses, including arbitrary arrest, extrajudicial killings and torture.
