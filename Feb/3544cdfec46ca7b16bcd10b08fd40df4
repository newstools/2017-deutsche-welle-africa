The Pyongyang regime on Wednesday accused the Malaysia government of colluding with South Korea&nbsp;in organizing the assassination of the Kim Jon Un's half-brother of Kim Jong Nam last week."The biggest responsibility for his death rests with the government of Malaysia as the citizen of the DPRK [North Korea] died in its land," the statement read."What merits more serious attention is the fact that the unjust acts of the Malaysian side are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the South Korean authorities," KCNA said.Malaysia initially told North Korea that "a person bearing a diplomatic passport" had died of a heart attack at Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13, Pyongyang's state-run KCNA news agency said. The agency&nbsp;added&nbsp;that Malaysia then rapidly changed its position. Reports later emerged in South Korea that the man had been poisoned to death, citing a spokesman for a state committee.A tit for tat spatMalaysian police have named a North Korean diplomat along with a state airline official who are wanted for questioning over the murder of Kim Jong Nam.Malaysia has denied North Korea's request for the body to be handed over to its embassy directly, saying it would be released to the next of kin, though no-one has come forward.KCNA reported that the Korean Jurists Committee "expressed outrage" at Malaysia's decision to perform two autopsies - describing it as "a wanton human rights abuse and an act contrary to human ethics and morality."
