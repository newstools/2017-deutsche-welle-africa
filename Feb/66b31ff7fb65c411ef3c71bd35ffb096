Wolfsburg 1-2 Werder Bremen (Mayoral 19' - Gnabry 10', 18')If only all of Werder Bremen s games were played away from home.Their star man Serge Gnabry has developed a handy knack of finding the net on the road, with nine of his ten Bundesliga goals coming away from Weser-Stadion, and Bremen s last three victories have also come on their travels.If Bremen survive a Bundesliga campaign that has ebbed more than it has flowed, then they ll owe a lot to the Germany forward they nabbed from Arsenal for 5 million pounds, a figure that looks like a snip and has had many Arsenal fans questioning why they sold him.Following a lean spell after the winter break that saw him go four games without a goal, Gnabry found his scoring touch last weekend at Mainz. Bremen now have back-to-back wins for the first time this year and, by winning at Wolfsburg, have not only enhanced their own chances of survival but punctured the hopes of one of their fellow strugglers.Bremen flew out of the blocks inside 10 minutes when Wolfsburg failed to deal with a routine cross from the left, allowing Gnabry to seize on it and drill a deflected shot beyond Diego Benaglio.Wolfsburg had barely dusted themselves down before Gnabry found the back of the net again. A dangerous cross from the right was again not cleared by an anxious Wolfsburg back line, and Gnabry classily brought the ball down and lashed it into the roof of the net from close-range.It was a double blow that ultimately proved fatal for a Wolfsburg side that once again demonstrated the flaky defence that has seen them ship 33 goals this season.Borja Mayoral quickly halved the deficit and Bremen rode their luck, with a Daniel Didavi free-kick and then Mayoral striking the post before the break. Alexander Nouri s side tightened things up in the second half and eventually saw out a 2-1 win that sees them climb above rivals Hamburg into 15th.The challenge for both Bremen and Gnabry now is to bring their away form to the Weser-Stadion.Wolfsburg 1-2 Werder Bremen, as it happened:
