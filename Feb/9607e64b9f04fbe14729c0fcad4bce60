The backdrop: Heading the Democratic National Committee is usually not a particularly glamorous job.&nbsp; That is because in the US political system, the national organizations of the two major parties play a rather limited role when compared to those in many other countries.Donald Trump s victory and early actions have sparked a backlash with millions of Americans protesting against him across the US. If the anti-Trump coalition is successful, it has little to do with the Democratic Party. (21.02.2017) Hearings to confirm Jeff Sessions as attorney general have taken a surprising turn, with Elizabeth Warren being reprimanded for reading a letter. The senator had cited scathing words by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow. (08.02.2017) US President Donald Trump still believes millions of people voted illegally in the November election, the White House has confirmed. The president also hinted at a major announcement on national security on Wednesday. (25.01.2017) Instead of the national party, most power rests with local, state and congressional legislators and officials who have considerable legroom in the positions they take and the campaigns they run. The role of the chair of the Democratic National Committee, the nominal party leader in lieu&nbsp;of a president, consists predominantly in helping to raise money, developing a strategy to increase voter turnout and recruiting potential candidates for office.Given the scope of the position, party leadership races tend to intrigue mostly political wonks rather than be followed closely by the general public. Not this time.Not only was a debate between eight candidates vying for the job shown live on national TV in the run-up to Saturday's election, but the intense campaign for the post -&nbsp;the most contentious in a long time -&nbsp;has also been covered extensively in the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It arguably all began with the controversial role played by former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz during the party's presidential primary. Wasserman Schultz, who was accused of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, resigned after the party's convention nominated Clinton as the Democratic candidate last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen before this much attention being paid to the race to lead the Democratic National Committee," said Jason Reifler, an American political scientist at the University of Exeter in Britain, who views the phenomenon as an indicator of the anger and opposition triggered by the election and behavior of Donald Trump especially, but not only, among Democrats.Tom Perez is supported by centrist DemocratsThe top candidates:Two contenders are generally deemed to have the best chance to win the Democratic Party's leadership race. The one is Keith Ellison, an African-American legislator from Minnesota, the first Muslim elected to Congress. The other is Tom Perez, a Hispanic politician from New York who served in the Obama justice department and as secretary of labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the race appears to boil down between an African-American Muslim and a Hispanic politician is significant in and of it self, noted Adam Ramey, who specializes in American politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi."They both represent a symbolic shift for the party and they would be unique in leading the party based on their personal histories," he said, adding that Ellison and Perez would also reflect the changing demographics in the country and the party.Despite their similarities, Ellison and Perez, according to observers, personify different strands of the Democratic Party.

Whoever wins here is going to be in charge of shepherding the Democrats through the next election cycle and redefining the message they want to use in that cycle."
