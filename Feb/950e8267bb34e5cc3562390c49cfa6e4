Vatican officials froze more than 2 million euros ($2.12 million) in cases suspected of being linked to money laundering in 2016. The move is part of the Holy See's drive to clean up its finances, as mandated by Pope Francis.The latest disclosure from chief magistrate Gian Pietro Milano, whose official title is Promoter of Justice, came during his annual address on the state of the Vatican's criminal justice system.Milano's speech was short on details, but he added that since 2013 a total of 13 million euros was frozen. The freezing of money followed alerts from the Vatican Financial Intelligence Authority (AIF), which the pope has given enhanced powers.Milano didn't reveal how much of the money was subsequently unblocked, following investigations, but he said that last year two cases led to indictments while three were shelved.The Vatican, a sovereign state surrounded by Rome, has, in recent years, enacted a number of provisions to clean up its finances and make them more transparent, particularly since Francis' election in 2013.
