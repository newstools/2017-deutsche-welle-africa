Kraft Heinz says it'll still keep trying after its surprise offer to buy British-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever was rejected.The shares of both companies surged to new highs in early trading after the 143-billion-dollar deal was announced. It would have created a global food and household products leader - bringing together Kraft cheese, Heinz ketchup, Oscar Mayer hot dogs and 200 other product lines with Unilever's 400 brands like Dove soap, Marmite yeast spread and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.Kraft Heinz's offer was 18 percent more than where Unilever's shares closed on Thursday. But Unilever said the price "fundamentally undervalues" the company, and that it saw no basis for further talks.
