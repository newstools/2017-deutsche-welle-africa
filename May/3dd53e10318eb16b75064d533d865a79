Anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders tweeted that the break down of coalition negotiations between four Dutch parties on Monday was "very good news" before adding that his Freedom Party (PVV) was "fully available" to join the next round of talks.Two weeks after the Dutch election, the politician leading talks to form a new coalition says it may take three months or more. But far-right leader Geert Wilders, whose party came second, is nowhere to be seen. (30.03.2017) Arnon Gr nberg is a Dutch author living in New York. Relieved by the election results, he discussed with DW some of the current problems his home country is dealing with. (16.03.2017) With his first-place finish in the Netherlands' elections, Mark Rutte has effectively halted the right-wing populist Geert Wilders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among the European leaders welcoming the result. (16.03.2017) Wilders and his right-wing populist PVV are not&nbsp;involved in the negotiations despite winning the second-largest number of seats in parliament, after Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other mainstream parties refused to work with him.Immigration policy was the main sticking point that forced the ending of several weeks of talks between Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Liberals (VVD), the Christian Democrats (CDA), the progressive Democracy Party (D66) and the leftist GreenLeft.It is likely that Rutte will now turn to another, smaller party such as the conservative Christian Union to secure a very narrow 76-seat majority but&nbsp;Monday's breakdown is likely to set back the formation of a government by months.Gap too wideGreenLeft, headed by the 31-year-old, charismatic Jesse Klaver, had campaigned for a more generous asylum policy, while the other parties advocated a tougher approach to head off criticism from Wilders.Doubts were raised at the beginning of talks over whether Klaver would be prepared to&nbsp;make the kind of compromises demanded by the other coalition hopefuls.As well as immigration, there were also differences over policies on&nbsp;climate change and income levels, Rutte told reporters."We wanted them to be successful, but we didn't succeed. We decided together that it just wouldn't work," he said.GreenLeft tweeted that "important differences were found to be too large."Rutte's VVD won the largest number of seats (33) in the March 15 election, but the party's close ties with the CDA and D66 were not&nbsp;enough to secure a majority in the 150-seat lower house, despite them winning 19 seats each.Green Left won 20 seats, thanks in part to charismatic leader Jesse Klaver, but they won't be part of the governmentGreen Left was seen as vital to securing a comfortable 85 seats, as well as a new cabinet in a reasonable timeframeDutch coalitions take an average of nearly three months to be formed. In 1977, it took a record 208 days to agree a new cabinet. Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2Yqukmm/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)
