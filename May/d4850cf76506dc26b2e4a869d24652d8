Mainz' sporting director, Rouven Schr der, (pictured above, left) appeared with Sandro Schwarz (above, right) at Wednesday's press conference to unveil the new coach. Schr der, who said the club's former under-23 coach had been given a contract until 2020, was a perfect fit for the job."We are pleased to have been able to get Sandro on board, Schr der said. He embodies Mainz, that's what we need. We need this change."Schwarz, 38, who is a native of Mainz, joined the club as a boy before graduating to the first team, where he played until 2004. After coaching stints in the lower divisions, Schwarz returned to Mainz in 2013, first coaching the under-19 team, before moving to the under-23 team two seasons later."To be sitting here now is a huge honor for me, a huge opportunity," Schwarz told reporters. "I am looking forward to working with these teams, I want to take the players forward and, together with the team, develop a style of football that is successful and will be met with enthusiasm from our fans."Schwarz replaces Martin Schmidt, who was let go by the club after Mainz barely avoided relegation this past season.pfd/mp (dpa, SID)
