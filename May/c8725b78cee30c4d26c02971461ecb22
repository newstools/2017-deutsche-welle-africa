"We must keep in mind that in order to succeed we need today discretion, moderation, mutual respect and a maximum of goodwill."Tusk's comments came hours after European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said "no one is trying to influence the outcome of the election campaign in the United Kingdom."Illusions or threats against Britain?May held a press conference outside Downing Street on Wednesday&nbsp;and accused politicians in Brussels of making "threats against Britain" over Brexit talks.
