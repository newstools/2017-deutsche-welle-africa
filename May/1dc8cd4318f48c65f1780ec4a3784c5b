Frontrunner Moon Jae-in is on course to become the next president of South Korea according to initial exit polls.&nbsp;Moon was estimated to have collected&nbsp;41.4 percent of the vote, according to the joint survey by three television stations. Conservative Hong Joon-Pyo was far behind on 23.3 percent, with centrist Ahn Cheol-Soo third on 21.8.Official results are still hours away.&nbsp;Voter turnout was high as South Koreans appeared keen to put a corruption scandal that shook the country to its foundations behind them. &nbsp;Former president Park Geun-hye was thrown out of office in March on charges of bribery and abuse of power. Korean news agency Yonhap put the turnout at 75 percent of 42.5 million registered voters, citing the National Election Commission&nbsp;an hour before the polling stations closed.A win by the liberal Moon would end a decade of rule for the conservative Grand National Party, once chaired by Park.The 64-year-old Moon plans to reform the country's powerful family-run businesses, boost fiscal spending and has called for a more moderate approach on North Korea. At the same time, he has stressed the importance of his country's alliance with the US.&nbsp;Moon, who&nbsp;narrowly lost to Park in 2012, would also need to face the growing youth unemployment and rising household debt during his five year-term.The winner of the vote is set to be sworn in on Wednesday.- South Korea faces a pivotal vote- South Korea's election to upend business as usual?
