"The cold hard fact is that if I lose just six seats I will lose this election, and Jeremy Corbyn will be sitting down to negotiate with the presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of Europe," May said in a Facebook post on Saturday.May purportedly called the election to strengthen her hand in talks with the 27 other EU members over the next two years as the UK prepares to leave the bloc.jm/cmk (Reuters)
