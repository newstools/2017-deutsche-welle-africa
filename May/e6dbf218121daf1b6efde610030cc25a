The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptor was fired Tuesday from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The US military said the test was successful.The US military played down expectations about the success of the GMD ahead of the test, saying it could go either way."We improve and learn from each test, regardless of the outcome. That's the reason we conduct them," said Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis."The system that we test today is a developmental system that's being flown for the first time and we look forward to understanding the results so we continue to mature the system and stay ahead of the threat," Davis added.Riki Ellison, the founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance based near Washington which advocates for the development and deployment of missile defense systems to defend the United States, described the test as "vital.""We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today," Ellison said.The test came amid growing fears about North Korea's advancing Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capability.- China, Japan wary of each other over advanced missile radars- North Korea crisis: Which country has the strongest military in the region?- Russia steps up North Korea support to constrain USOn Monday, the isolated communist country launched a ballistic missile that was believed to have traveled around 450 kilometers (280 miles) before falling into the Sea of Japan.
