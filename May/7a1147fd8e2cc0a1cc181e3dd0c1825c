The inconsistencies continued for German Angelique Kerber two days after she returned to the top ranking position in the WTA as she suffered a 6-4, 6-0 loss to Anett Kontaveit in the second round of the Rome Masters.The knockout - with Kerber losing serve five times - left her struggling to find form and fitness ahead of the French Open starting next week.Kerber came to Rome after extensive treatment on a leg injury suffered last week in Madrid, where she reached the third round but had to retire mid-match against Eugenie Bouchard."For sure it's not the easiest time right now for me," Kerber said."I have to look for solutions right now. I think that my movement is not the best, especially on clay."My legs are always important for my game, but I'm really not feeling so good on clay. I will try going back home and thinking what can I do to be back in Paris - this is the next big goal."In the men's second round, Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic dumped out veteran Tommy Haas 6-4, 6-3 while German 16th seed Alexander Zverev beat Serb Viktor Troicki 6-3, 6-4. Juan Martin Del Potro dispatched Britain's Kyle Edmund 7-5, 6-4.Among the women, second seed Karolina Pliskova hammered Lauren Davis 6-1, 6-1 while Madrid winner Simona Halep beat Laura Siegemund 6-4, 6-4.
