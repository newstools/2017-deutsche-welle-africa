German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made another&nbsp;pitch for frontrunner Emmanuel Macron days before he faces the&nbsp;anti-immigrant candidate Marine Le Pen in a runoff for the presidency."Naturally, it is and remains the decision of the French voters, which I won't interfere with," Merkel told Cologne-based daily&nbsp;'Stadt-Anzeiger'. "However, I would be very pleased if Emmanuel Macron were to win, because he stands for consistently pro-European policy." Merkel, who received Macron in Berlin in March and believes he could be a "strong president for France," added that "his victory would be a good sign for the political center, whose strength we would like to maintain here in Germany, as well."Former investment banker and government minister Macron describes himself as "neither right nor left," and founded the independent 'En Marche' party ahead of the election.Read: What Le Pen and Macron stand for In an historic vote, Macron and Le Pen narrowly&nbsp;emerged as the preferred of 11 presidential candidates in April.
