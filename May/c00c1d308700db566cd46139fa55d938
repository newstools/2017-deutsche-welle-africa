Toshiba, whose US nuclear arm Westinghouse Electric had&nbsp;filed for bankruptcy protection, said Monday it was on track to log a&nbsp;$8.4-billion (7.7-billion-euro) loss for its fiscal year that ended in March.The company hastened to add that the figure was a mere projection rather than part of a proper earnings report as it had not been able to secure auditors' approval in time.Failing to meet the first deadline, Toshiba now has until the end of June to officially file its results with the Japanese Finance Ministry, after twice postponing its nine-month results over accounting irregularities surrounding its US nuclear subsidiary.Fighting battles on many frontsToshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa had said the strategy based on Westinghouse was a mistake and promised it wouldn't take on any new nuclear projects.
