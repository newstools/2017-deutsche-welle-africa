When asked during a press conference whether he had ever urged Comey to end the probe into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Trump swiftly interrupted the reporter, saying, "No, no."On Tuesday, US media reported that the former FBI chief had written a memo describing how Trump urged him to drop the probe into ties between Flynn and Russia. Trump allegedly told him during a White House meeting that "I hope you can let this go," referring to the investigation.Trump fired Comey as head of the FBI last week, saying the dismissal was driven by a loss of faith in the bureau chief on behalf of both himself and the public.The president said he thought the ousting would be greeted with bipartisan support.
