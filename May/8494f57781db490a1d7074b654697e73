North Korea on Sunday fired a projectile that appeared to be a ballistic missile, marking the first of its kind since the election of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Moon convened an emergency National Security Council meeting in response to the launch, according to a statement from the presidency.South Korea's&nbsp;Joint Chiefs of Staff said Pyongyang had fired an "unidentified projectile" from Kusong, northwest of the North Korean capital, without further elaborating on the situation.South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the projectile is believed to be a ballistic missile and traveled roughly 700 kilometers (435 miles). It marks the fifth consecutive attempt&nbsp;by North Korea to test-launch ballistic missiles in the past two months.US Pacific Command said it had detected the missile launch, but noted that the data was not consistent with the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.'Grave threat'Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that Pyongyang's decision to fire a ballistic missile violated several UN resolutions that ban the communist nation from developing such weapons technology."North Korea's repeated missile launches are a grave threat to our country and a clear violation of UN resolutions," Abe said.Pyongyang has attempted to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US mainland.Analysts believe that while Pyongyang has yet to reach its goal, the country has made progress on its ballistic missiles program.Conditional diplomacyTensions have risen on the Korean Peninsula after US President Donald Trump's administration deployed a naval attack group to the region last month in response to threats from Pyongyang.Trump later said he would be "honored" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "under the right circumstances."Pyongyang has also made overtures for discussions with Washington, stipulating that it would be open to talks "under the right conditions."However, the installation of the missile defense system THAAD has prompted concerns from North Korea and its key regional ally, China. The defense system went operational earlier this month, according to US authorities.In February, China banned all coal imports from North Korea. Under tight conditions, North Korea may still export $400.87 million (374 million euros) or 7.5 million metric tons of coal per year, whichever is less.

North Korea is prohibited from opening banks abroad, and UN member states are prohibited from operating financial institutions on Pyongyang's behalf. Any dealings that might help North Korea skirt the sanctions are banned, and UN member states must expel and repatriate anyone working on the regime's financial behalf.This North Korean cargo ship found itself boarded for inspection in the Philippines in March 2016 after the United Nations ordered member nations to de-register any vessel owned, operated or crewed on orders from Pyongyang. North Korean ships also cannot fly the flags of other nations to evade sanctions. Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, remains exempt from aviation sanctions and still has scheduled flights to China and Russia, as well as several domestic routes. However, the airline cannot fly to the European Union, which has banned it on safety grounds, and the United States prevents citizens from legally conducting business with the carrier.In theory, North Koreans can still cruise the country in Pyeonghwa sedans, as UN sanctions only currently ban the sale of aviation, jet and rocket fuel to Pyongyang. Crude and similar oils remain permitted - for now. The automaker, owned in a joint venture with the deceased North Korean Reverend Sun Myung Moon's influential Unification Church, only cranks out a few hundred cars a year.UN sanctions limit North Korea's diplomats abroad - at the country's Berlin embassy, for example - to only one bank account each. North Korea is also not permitted to own real estate abroad for any purposes other than consular.It's a safe bet that North Korea's marching military did not learn its moves abroad: UN sanctions ban foreign security forces from training the country's army, police or paramilitary units. The United Nations does permit medical exchanges, but otherwise allow very little assistance of scientific or technical value.Anyone wanting to own a larger-than-life Kim will have to await the end of North Korea's nuclear program. The UN sanctions currently ban the sale of statues by the nation.ls/cmk (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)
