I look forward to it very much - many of the same things (in) common," he added.Close US allyBahrain's leader said the two countries relations were "based on a very good foundation of mutual understanding and strategy."Bahrain, which was designated as a "Major Non-NATO Ally" by Washington in 2002, hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet and takes part in US-led military coalitions.
