A recently unveiled&nbsp;Russian plan to stabilize Syria after more than six years of civil war is the most urgent foreign policy topic on the agenda, according to The Associated Press.Both governments have said they&nbsp;want to end a civil war that has killed up to 400,000 people and allowed the self-proclaimed&nbsp;Islamic State (IS)&nbsp;to emerge as a global terror threat.The continued fighting between rebels and the Moscow-backed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's military has complicated US efforts to defeat IS.A plan is a planLavrov arrives in the US capital after discussing&nbsp;an agreement with Iran and Turkey last week.The plan focuses on the creation of four de-escalation zones,&nbsp;which&nbsp;would not cover areas where the US-led coalition is fighting IS.Details still need to be finalized and the US response has been cautious, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis saying administration officials are still studying the concept and its various unanswered questions.Best of enemies?The meeting will be the highest-level contact between Trump and the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin since Trump took office on January 20.Lavrov&nbsp;hasn't visited Washington at all since 2013, a year before Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and two years before it intervened militarily in Syria to help Assad remain in power.Relations apparently deteriorated between the US and Russia after US air strikes hit a Syrian airfield in April in response to a chemical weapons attack that Washington blamed on Assad.The meeting could signal that the two governments&nbsp;have improved ties that Trump recently described as being at an "all-time low."Lavrov will meet earlier in the day with&nbsp;Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, The Associated Press learned.

He calls the various investigations a "hoax" driven by Democrats.jbh/kl (Reuters, AP)
