The European Council on Monday agreed the broad lines of a reform to the system of approving vehicles in Europe in order to prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen emissions scandal.The Council, which in the EU system of checks and balances gives the 28 heads of government a say in decision-making, wants to reduce the power of national authorities and empower the European Commission to test and inspect vehicles to ensure compliance with emissions standards.Under the present system, national bodies such as Germany's KBA authority have the power to clear new vehicles for the whole European Union, and can also revoke approvals.The Commission should also have the power to fine manufacturers up to 30,000 euros per vehicle if they are found to be cheating, the new draft says."Above all, the objective is building trust and credibility again in the European type-approval system," said Chris Cardona, the economy minister of Malta, which holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency.The new rules, which still have to be discussed with the EU executive Commission as well as the European Parliament before becoming law, are a response to Volkswagen's so-called Dieselgate scandal. In 2015, the German carmaker admitted it had used illegal software in about 11 million of its diesel vehicles to cheat during emission tests.Since then, investigations of various other carmakers have revealed on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions as high as 15 times the regulatory limits, as well as the use of devices to deceive emissions tests and mask real vehicle emissions.

In addition, it urged the EU Commission and Parliament to "stick to their guns" and push member states to agree on a more ambitious final package.
