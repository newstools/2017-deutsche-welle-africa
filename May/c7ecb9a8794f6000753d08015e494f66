"The threats Europe face do not stop at national borders. Fragmentation makes us all collectively more vulnerable," said Europol Director Rob Wainwright and EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos in a jointly-authored article published Friday.Over the past year, the EU's law enforcement coordination agency, Europol , has pushed for increased cooperation between the bloc's member states in a bid to curb the rising threat of terrorism on European soil.Last week, as a new regulation to modernize Europol's ability to tackle criminal and terrorist threats came into effect, the EU agency announced it had coordinated an operation that assessed more than 2,000 online items of extremist content hosted across 52 platforms.The two-day operation brought together law enforcement agents from Belgium, Greece, Poland, Portugal and the United States to target accounts "used by terrorist groups to radicalize, recruit [and] direct terrorist activities."However, Europol's director said at a press conference in London that the operation discovered attempts by the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) militant group to develop "its very own social media platform" in a bid to evade authorities, spread propaganda and seek financial support.Evolution of terrorism tacticsWhile IS has notably used social media platforms to spread its message and gain followers, Europol's latest revelation shows the militant group's ability to shift its methods and evolve in response to growing pressure from authorities.Wainwright said Europol's discovery showed that members of IS have continued "to innovate in this space."But the militant group's strategy to expand its violent ideology isn't solely restricted to online outreach. Although editions of the IS magazine "Rumiyah" have circulated online, its latest publication provides "terror tactics" that can be adopted by the group's sympathizers or supporters."Due to its proximity to many conflict zones and due to its porous borders, firearms are widely available in Europe, facilitating their acquisition by means of gun dealers and underground criminal networks - for those capable of attaining those connections - which are widespread and rampant throughout Europe," the militant group said, according to London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence (ICSR) research fellow Rajan Basra.The publication also outlined ways in which to lure potential victims and use resources at hand to carry out attacks on European soil. With such information available online for supporters and sympathizers to act on, the advantages of increased coordination between member states become even more relevant.Despite IS' gradual loss of territory in Iraq and Syria, analysts have warned that military operations will not mark the end of the group's vision for a proto-state, warning that it would be "wrong to imagine a 'post-Islamic State' world at this time.""If compelled to, the group's true believers will simply retreat into the virtual world, where they will use the vast archive of propaganda assembled by the group over these past few years to keep themselves buoyant with nostalgia," said Middle East researcher Charlie Winter in a report published in February by the ICSR.

"Strategic and tactical targeting at a global scale are the most prominent factors to effectively counter or temporarily neutralize future terrorist threats in Western Europe."The Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) is a platform used by EU law enforcement agencies to request and access crime-related information through Europol'The only option'Under the new regulation that went into effect May 1, the European Parliament expanded Europol's ability to serve member states' law enforcement coordination needs, including establishing increased oversight and data protection measures."Europol's support function has been extended to now include providing operational, technical and financial support to member states' cross-border information-sharing activities, operations and investigations," Europol spokeswoman Tine Hollevoet told DW."Cooperation can, of course, always be improved, but member states have acknowledged the added value of Europol. For example, information sharing through Europol has increased ten-fold since 2014," Hollevoet said.With the increased threat of terror attacks on European soil in the wake of deadly assaults in Berlin, Paris and Brussels, a bolstered Europol that assists member states in combating terrorism and organized crime becomes an instrumental aspect of collective European security.However, it is up to member states to use the resources available through Europol to actively meet the challenges presented by criminal organizations and terrorist groups."The threats we face today in Europe, and beyond, will not go away any time soon. We must be ready," warned Wainwright and Avramopoulos. "Pulling together is the only option we have."Islamic State (IS) - also known as ISIL, ISIS and Daesh - is an al Qaeda splinter group with militant Sunni Islamist idealogy. It emerged in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group's goal is to create an Islamic state, or "caliphate", across Iraq, Syria and beyond.IS is believed to be operational in 18 countries across the world. It controls territory in Iraq and Syria, and its de facto capital is Raqqa, in Syria. However, the group has lost more than a quarter of its territory since January 2015. There are many groups involved in the fight against IS. The United States is leading air strikes by an international coalition of more than 50 countries, including several Arab nations. Russia has conducted air strikes in support of the Syrian government. Regional forces, such as the Kurdish Peshmerga (pictured above), are fighting on the ground.One of the group's main sources of income has been oil and gas - it still controls an estimated one third of Syria's oil production. However, US-led air strikes are deliberately targeting this valuable asset. Other means of income include taxes, ransoms and selling looted antiquities.IS has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks across the globe. The most deadly to date was a suicide bombing this year in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in which more than 200 people died and many more were injured. IS leaders have encouraged so-called "lone wolf" attacks, whereby individuals who support IS can carry out terrorist acts without the direct involvement of the group.The group uses various tactics to expand its power. IS fighters have looted and destroyed historical artefacts in Syria and Iraq in an attempt at "cultural cleansing", and thousands of women from religious minorites have been enslaved. The group also uses social media as a propaganda and recruitment tool.Around six million Syrians have fled abroad as a result of the ongoing conflict - many to neighboring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, but also further afield to Europe. More than three million Iraqis have been displaced within the country. Author: Rachel Stewart
