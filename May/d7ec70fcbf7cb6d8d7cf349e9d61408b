She also described a toxic atmosphere in which women often suffered "disparaging treatment" in the newsroom. She filed a lawsuit against Ailes in early July.Fall from graceTwo weeks later, he stepped down from his position as both CEO and chairman of the company, a startling turn of events for Ailes, who founded Fox News in 1996 and rose to become one of the most powerful men in American journalism.Ailes' fall from grace was just one of a series of similar scandals plaguing the network.
