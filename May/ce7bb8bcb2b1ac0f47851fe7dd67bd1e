A group of 220 student girls was kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok in 2014.&nbsp;About 21 of them were released in a deal with the kidnappers brokered by Switzerland and the International Red Cross.&nbsp;A handful of others have either escaped or been rescued, but 195 were still missing.&nbsp;A Nigerian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,&nbsp;said the girls were released on Saturday following negotiations between the government and Boko Haram militants."The government will soon release an official statement," a government spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Security sources in the town of Banki, in Borno state, said that at least 80 Chibok girls&nbsp;had been brought there for medical checks before being airlifted on Sunday to Maiduguri. The exact number was yet to be confirmed.The personal assistant to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Bashir Ahmad, tweeted that "huge numbers" had been released.&nbsp;Last month President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement that the government was "in constant touch through negotiations, through local intelligence to secure the release of the remaining girls and other abducted persons unharmed"The government denied that it paid a ransom for the girls' release and said it had freed some detained Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls.For&nbsp;more than two years after the kidnapping there was no sign of the missing girls but the discovery of one of them with a baby in May last year fuelled hope. Two more girls who successfully escaped have also since been discovered.A campaign #bringbackourgirls has been active in seeking the girls' release. A campaign representative said that it was awaiting confirmation on how many girls had been released.&nbsp;"Our hopes and expectations are high as we look forward to this news being true and confirmed," the campaign said.&nbsp;More to come&nbsp;dm/jm (Reuters, AFP)
