German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier appeared to have mended ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a meeting on Sunday, ending a recent disagreement over German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel's decision to meet with rights groups critical of Israeli policies in the Palestinian territories.At a joint press conference with Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Steinmeier said German-Israeli relations were strong enough to "weather some storms from the past two weeks."The Israeli premier hailed his country's "unique partnership" with Germany;&nbsp;he did not mention the diplomatic spat directly.Steinmeier pointed to his visit to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial earlier on Sunday as a "commemoration that our generation should never forget where we came from and what we have to achieve."Diplomatic spatNetanyahu called off an April 25 meeting with Steinmeier's replacement as foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, after Gabriel&nbsp;refused to cancel talks with groups critical of Israel's government.Gabriel met members of Breaking the Silence, an Israeli veterans group that highlights military abuses in the Palestinian territories, and B'Tselem, which works on a number of rights issues and strongly opposes the expansion of settlements.Netanyahu's right-wing government has complained that such groups unfairly tarnish Israel's image and provide support to the country's critics. Steinmeier has not scheduled meetings with either group.

He said Steinmeier's Israel visit would be a chance for both countries to deepen their ties.Steinmeier will hold talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at his Ramallah headquarters in the occupied West Bank on Monday.
