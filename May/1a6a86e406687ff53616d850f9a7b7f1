French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen did not say she was quoting Francois Fillon when she addressed her supporters at a May Day rally north of Paris. But French media reported Tuesday that, in her speech, she appeared to repeat almost verbatim three passages from an address the Les Republicains candidate delivered last month in Puy-en-Velay.The similarities were first picked up by satirical YouTube channel Ridicule TV, which is reportedly close to Fillon. The channel posted a video of the two candidates as they proclaimed the same statements.

Le Pen used those&nbsp;same quotes in her speech, which comes ahead of Sunday's second round run-off.The similarities prompted "Le Monde" and other French media to accuse Le Pen of plagiarism. Deputy chairman of Le Pen's National Front party Florian Philippot&nbsp;defended the address, saying it contained a deliberate "nod to a short passage in a speech about France" on the part of "a candidate that shows she is not sectarian."
