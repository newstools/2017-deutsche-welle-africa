The 29-year-old started last year strongly with wins at the&nbsp;French and Australian Opens&nbsp;but then lost his number 1 ranking to Andy Murray before exiting&nbsp;in the third round at Wimbledon, the&nbsp;first round at the Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;Olympics and the third round of the Australian Open at the start of this year. &nbsp;Djokovic said he hopes the move, which comes just a few weeks before the 2017 French Open will&nbsp;ensure he regains&nbsp;"the winning spark on the court again."He announced on Friday on&nbsp;his website that he had&nbsp;"mutually agreed"&nbsp;with Vajda, fitness coach Gebhard Phil Gritsch, and physiotherapist&nbsp;Miljan Amanovic to end their "successful and long term partnership"&nbsp;two weeks ago after the Monte Carlo Masters, where he lost in&nbsp;quarterfinals."It was not an easy decision, but we all felt that we need a&nbsp;change," Djokovic added.Boris Becker quit Djokovic's coaching team in 2016Vajda started working with Djokovic in 2006, and the last three&nbsp;seasons together with Boris Becker, who quit last year."We arrived to the point where we all realized we need new energy&nbsp;in the team," Vajda saide. "Novak can do so much more&nbsp;and I am sure he will."Djokovic said he believes this "shock therapy" will help him&nbsp;achieve better results.&nbsp;"I want to continue raising the level of my game and stamina and&nbsp;this is a continuous process," Djokovic said. "I enjoy this journey,&nbsp;it feels like I am starting something new again."For now, the world number 2 will go without a coach.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be on the tour alone for a while with the support of my&nbsp;family and management," he said.mp/rd (Reuters/AP)
