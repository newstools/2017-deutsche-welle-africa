A range of new programs designed to bolster the European Union&nbsp;will be at the top of the agenda on Monday, when the two leaders meet. Merkel has already publicly backed Macron's call for a new European investment program to boost growth within the bloc."We are happy to think about joint investment programs because Germany also needs to catch up in the digital field," Merkel told a media function Thursday while on the campaign trail in North Rhine-Westphalia, where state elections are being held this weekend. The vote on Sunday in Germany's most populous state is widely considered to be a litmus test for September's federal elections.
