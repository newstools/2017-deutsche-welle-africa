Treasurer Scott Morrison said Tuesday that pumping more money into infrastructure projects would create jobs and guarantee essential services.Among other things, the Australian government earmarked 5.3 billion Australian dollars (3.6 billion euros, $3.9 billion) for the construction of a second international airport in Sydney, slated to be ready by 2026.It also announced 8.4 billion Australian dollars for an inland freight rail line connecting Melbourne and Brisbane, along with billions more for other road and rail projects."The budget is about making the right choices to secure the better days ahead," Morrison said in sticking to his promise to return a surplus by 2021/22 from a projected 2017/18 deficit of 29.4 billion Australian dollars.Creditworthiness in focusThe government is keen to keep the country's&nbsp;coveted AAA credit rating and has been wary of an overheating property market fueled by interest rates slashed to record lows to boost growth as the economy shifts from a dependence on mining-driven expansion.
