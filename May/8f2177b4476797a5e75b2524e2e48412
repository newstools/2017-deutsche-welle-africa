Pakistani army shelling into Indian-controlled Kashmir killed two civilians and injured three more on Saturday, prompting Indian forces to fire back across the heavily militarized ceasefire line.The civilians, a girl and her father, were killed by "indiscriminate" mortar fire on the Rajouri district on the Indian side of the de facto border known as the Line of Control, said Indian defense spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Manish Mehta."The Indian Army posts are retaliating strongly and effectively. The firing is presently on," Mehta said in a statement, adding that schools in the area had been closed.The incident comes amid rising tensions along the Line of Control separating Indian and Pakistan-administered parts of Kashmir, where a fragile truce has been in effect since 2003.Two people were killed, one on each side of the border, on Thursday. Earlier in the week, India accused suspected Pakistani-backed rebels of abducting and killing a military officer who was on leave, allegations Islamabad denied.Read: Kashmiri youth: The new face of violent resistance against Indian ruleKashmir has been divided between Pakistan and India since the end of British rule in 1947.
