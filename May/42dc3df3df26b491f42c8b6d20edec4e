Tens of thousands of British Airways' customers were left stranded on Saturday after the airline was forced to cancel all of its scheduled flights from London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports due to a computer breakdown."We have experienced a major IT system failure that is causing very severe disruption to our flight operations worldwide," the airline said in a statement.At first, the airline announced that it was canceling "all flights until 6.00 pm (1700 GMT) from Heathrow and Gatwick today," a spokesman told AFP. But later, it admitted the disruption would last for the rest of the day.Flights to resume on SundayOn its website, BA said it expected London-bound long-haul flights to land as scheduled on Sunday, but that thousands of travelers from the two airports may continue to face delays due to staff and aircraft being in the wrong location. The company later said it was "aiming to operate a near normal schedule at Gatwick and the majority of services from Heathrow on Sunday."In a video message to affected customers, BA's Chairman and CEO Alex Cruz said the airline would "make arrangements to get customers on their way as soon as we possibly can."Some British media speculated the system failure was the result of a cyberattack but BA rejected that claim.The airline said it had found "no evidence that it's a cyberattack," with Britain still recovering from a ransomware attack that crippled key infrastructure earlier this month.Stuck on runways and in terminalsThe system failure is causing massive delays with planes stuck on runways, and the terminals at London's two major airports getting extremely crowded.Passengers at London's Heathrow Airport reported flight delays and long queues at check-in counters.BA said the crash also affect its website, mobile app and call centers and told passengers not to travel to the two airports.Meanwhile, some frustrated customers took to Twitter to voice their complaints."Still on the tarmac at Leeds. #Britishairways reckon Heathrow is so backed up we can't set off. No way we'll make our Vegas flight," one passenger, David Raine, wrote on Twitter.The disruption comes at the start of a three-day weekend in Britain.Online check-inLondon's Heathrow Airport, one of the world's busiest, said it was working with BA.Passenger Roshni Burt, who was flying from Heathrow to Bahrain with her young son, said there was no news about when her flight would depart."When we left the check-in area there were angry people, people getting frustrated that their flights were coming up or near to departure, people getting turned away ... with BA staff basically saying, 'If you've not checked in online, you've missed your flight'," she told Sky News.shs,bik,mm/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)
