Werder Bremen announced the extension of the 37-year-old coach's contract in a statement posted on their website on Monday."We've sat down together over the last few weeks and discussed many important things about continuing to work together long-term. We're delighted to be able to confirm that we will continue our partnership," the club's sporting director, Frank Baumann, said."Alex took over the team in autumn and, at the time, we needed him to get us out of a difficult situation. He's done that brilliantly. In the second half of the season he has led us up the table one step at a time. Therefore, we want to extend the contract and continue to develop Werder further," Baumann added.No details of the contract extension were made public, so it is not clear for how long Werder have secured Nouri's services.'Journey with Werder' not over"Even in February when results weren't going our way, I was certain that my journey with Werder was not over. I always had the feeling it would continue. I'm pleased with the faith that the club has placed in me, the support of the fans and the passionate and hungry team," said Nouri, who took over as head coach on a caretaker basis after Viktor Skripnik was sacked in mid-September.&nbsp; A few weeks later, the "interim" coach became the head coach.The northern Germans got off to a slow start under his tutelage, but went on a run in the second half of the season&nbsp;that has seen them climb from the relegation zone&nbsp;to within striking distance of European qualification.
