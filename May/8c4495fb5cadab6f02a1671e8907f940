A subversive sculpture of the former Spanish leader Francisco Franco has upset his supporters and raised questions over his legacy. From the Spanish Civil War to the Middle East conflict, war has always drawn writers and photographers like Ernest Hemingway and Robert Capa, author Amanda Veill tells DW, though it hasn't done them much good. (15.07.2016) Hundreds of monuments and plaques across the Spanish capital dedicated to the Franco era may be removed if Madrid s government has its way. As Martin Delfin reports, the controversy is opening historic wounds. (09.02.2016) Spanish parliament debated on Tuesday whether to dig up the body of fascist dictator Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen memorial.Franco was buried in the massive mausoleum near Madrid in 1975, controversially joining thousands of victims of the civil war.Spain's socialists have pushed for his exhumation for years, arguing his presence sullies the memory of the fallen and acts as a pilgrimage site for Francoists. He is the only person buried at the site who did not die in the civil war.Franco ordered the monument's construction after his victory in 1939, ostensibly to honor all of those who died in the in 32-month war and reconcile the nation. His burial there was unexpected and against his wishes, but it was hastily ordered by the interim government appointed after his death.An expert panel, appointed by the then-ruling Socialist Party, called in 2011 for the site to be converted into a politically-neutral memorial for victims of his regime, and for his body to be removed.The Valley of the Fallen was partially built using forced laborBut the 2011-elected government of the still-ruling People's Party abandoned the plans, saying it was unnecessary and would stoke divisions in Spain. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy repeated the position several times over the following years.The lower house was due to vote on the Socialist Party's latest proposal on Thursday, but even if it passes the ruling party would have no obligation to enforce it.The socialists called for the removal of all Francoist symbols from the site, and for mass graves from the so-called White Terror to be exhumed.Franco's body lies inside the consecrated Catholic basilica, against his wishesVarious political parties sought to add amendments to the laws - including the annulment of Francoist trials.The Valley of the Fallen was finished 1958 in the Sierra de Guadarrama, about 60 kilometers northwest of Madrid. It was partly built using forced labor.France is buried in a basilica crowned by a 150-meter white cross.In February the Spanish Supreme Court overturned a ruling to exhume and transfer the body of the dictator and Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the fascist Spanish Phalanx party and a figure venerated by Franco.
