Three former Obama administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to be able to divulge the private conversation, said that during an Oval Office meeting shortly after the 2016 election, Obama directly warned Trump against appointing Michael Flynn to his cabinet. The information could suggest that concerns over Flynn's background rose to the highest level of government.A number of congressional committees launched investigations after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the 2016 election toward Trump.&nbsp;Flynn has emerged as a central figure in those probes.Moscow denies any such interference.Precarious timingThe news about Obama's warning to Trump came just hours before the highly anticipated hearing before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates as part of the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election.Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates reportedly tried to raise her concerns to Trump's incoming administration - apparently to no end In her first appearance on Capitol Hill since being fired in January just ten days into office, Yates is expected to explain under oath the concerns she had raised to the Trump administration, particularly to White House counsel Don McGahn, about contacts between Flynn and Russia.Yates, a longtime federal prosecutor and Obama administration appointee, was&nbsp;fired by Trump on January 31&nbsp;after refusing to defend the administration's travel ban on certain Muslim countries.Trump defends his courseYates reportedly&nbsp;warned Trump that Flynn had discussed US-imposed sanctions on Russia with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period. Flynn left his position in February 2017 after widespread media reports indicating that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations he had held with the Russian envoy.The White House rejected reports indicating that Flynn was deliberately misleading the administration, with Trump distancing himself from both his former adviser&nbsp;and blaming the Obama administration for giving Flynn "the highest security clearance" when he worked at the Pentagon.Trump made no mention in his remarks, however, that Flynn had been already fired by the Obama administration in 2014. He further insinuated that Yates had deliberately leaked information on Flynn to the media, apparently misspelling the word "counsel" in his tweet.Obama's former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who retired when Trump took office, will also testify to the Senate panel later in the day.ss/cl&nbsp;(AP, Reuters)&nbsp;
