Germany's transition to becoming more environmentally conscious is proving effective, according to the Agora Energiewende initiative, which announced Tuesday that most of the country's&nbsp;energy over the past weekend had come from renewable energy sources.On April 30, many coal-fired power stations in Germany&nbsp;were not in operation. Those that were online were only operational between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. and produced less than 8 gigawatts of energy, well below the maximum output of about 50 gigawatts.Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, provided most of the power over the weekend, producing upwards of 85 percent of electricity on Sunday.Nuclear shutdownNuclear energy sources were also reduced over the weekend. Germany is working toward shutting down all of its nuclear power plants by 2022, a decision made following the disaster at the Fukushima power plant in Japan in 2011.Patrick Graichen of Agora Energiewende said days like April 30&nbsp;would be "completely normal" by 2030.Germany is not the only European nation trying to wean itself from nonrenewable energy sources. According to local media reports, the UK went entirely without coal-fired energy on April 21, the first time the country had done so since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.kbd/cmk (AFP, dpa)
