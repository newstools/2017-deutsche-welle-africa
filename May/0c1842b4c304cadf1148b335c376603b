France's new President Emmanuel Macron officially took over&nbsp;the reigns of power on Sunday, facing the challenges of a polarized country, high unemployment, terrorism and working with Germany to reform the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 39-year-old independent took over from outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande, who leaves office after five&nbsp;years as the most unpopular president in French history.The former investment banker and economy minister in the Socialist government met&nbsp;privately with Hollande at the Elysee presidential palace to discuss sensitive issues, including the country's nuclear codes.In his first speech as president, Macron spoke of providing "hope" and "confidence"&nbsp;after years in which people doubted themselves and French power. He also said the European Union would be "reformed and relaunched" during his term. &nbsp;&nbsp;After the transfer of power, a 21-gun military salute rung through Paris, kicking off a day of ceremonies, speeches, parades and meetings.Then the hard work of governing begins. Macron plans to appoint a prime minister by Monday and a government on Tuesday. On Monday,&nbsp;he will head&nbsp;to Berlin to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel, highlighting the importance of the Franco-German relationship at the heart of an embattled EU.
