In the first quarter of 2017, demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) grew significantly, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) reported on its website Thursday.By definition, AFVs are cars that do not run on traditional petroleum fuels (petrol or diesel) and are generally considered to be more environmentally-friendly.ACEA said new AFV registrations jumped by 37.6 percent to 212,945 units across the European Union, excluding Croatia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia where relevant figures were not available for the period under review.
