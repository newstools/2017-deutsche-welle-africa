A two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) concluded in Italy Saturday with the United States continuing to oppose a free trade commitment between leading Western industrial nations.The US refused to abandon its protectionist stance as the G7 - composed of the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - continued to wrangle over a common trade policy.The lack of consensus was reflected in the blandness of the meeting's closing statement, which avoided a precise trade agreement.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talks to journalists at the G7But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed afterwards that major trading partners "are much more comfortable" with the Trump administration's trade policies and understand US growth will benefit them."We do not want to be protectionist, but we reserve our right to be protectionist to the extent that we believe trade is not free and fair," Mnuchin told a news conference at the end of the two-day gathering.But ministers from the other G7 countries made it clear they did not share the US secretary's view.

He addressed the ministers at the meeting.
