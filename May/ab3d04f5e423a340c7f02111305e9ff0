Speaking at&nbsp;his second congress as FIFA president in Bahrain on Thursday, Infantino issued an impassioned defense against widespread criticism over the ousting of FIFA's&nbsp;top ethics officials - judge Hans-Joachim Eckert and&nbsp;prosecutor Cornel Borbely, who&nbsp;later accused&nbsp;the Swiss national of jeopardizing the reform&nbsp;of the organization.In a speech that led many to draw comparisons to another president, America's Donald Trump, Infantino said he believed there was an agenda against FIFA, who have been hit by a series of scandals in recent years."Sadly, the truth is not what is necessarily true but what people&nbsp;believe is true," he said.&nbsp;"There is a lot of fake news and alternative facts about FIFA&nbsp;circulating.&nbsp;FIFA bashing has become a national sport in some&nbsp;countries."He later &nbsp;acknowledged he could not support his comments&nbsp;with facts.&nbsp;Asked&nbsp;by reporters to provide examples of "fake news,"&nbsp;Infantino said: "Generally, it's my feeling.&nbsp;It's not the media I was meaning. There are a lot of people&nbsp;spreading a lot of wrong and false information."Dissent in the ranksOthers within FIFA were quick to distance themselves from their leader, including former&nbsp;presidential candidate and head of the Jordanian football federation&nbsp;Prince Ali, who said FIFA&nbsp;has "already lost the battle of public opinion."Germany's&nbsp;Reinhard Grindel, a newly-elected&nbsp;member of Infantino's ruling council also criticized the nature of the departures of Eckert and Berbely.Reinhard Grindel questioned the transparency of a recent FIFA decision"This is certainly not how we should make such sensitive decisions&nbsp;in the future," said Grindel, the German federation president.Despite recent events, Infantino, who replaced the disgraced Sepp Blatter&nbsp;&nbsp;in February 2016, insisted the&nbsp;"crisis is over" for&nbsp;world football's governing body. However, a&nbsp;Kuwaiti member of his council recently abandoned&nbsp;plans to seek&nbsp;re-election after being accused of bribery by American authorities."We are rebuilding the credibility of FIFA. The new FIFA is a&nbsp;democracy. It is not a dictatorship," Infantino said. "New FIFA, it is&nbsp;a transparent organization, not an organization that is fiddling&nbsp;around with facts and figures. It is a deeply honest organization."New prosecutor will investigate all casesHans-Joachim Eckert was ousted from FIFA's ethics committeeThe candidates to replace Eckert and Borbely, Colombian lawyer Maria Claudia Rojas and&nbsp;Greek Vassilios Skouris, were approved by congress as their&nbsp;successors with 188 of 194 valid votes, while in other votes India's&nbsp;Mukul Mugdal was confirmed as governance committee chairman.Rojas told&nbsp;globoesporte.com she would&nbsp;continue to investigate all cases opened by her predecessor.It was also decided that FIFA&nbsp;will&nbsp;elect the host of the 2026&nbsp;World Cup, the first with&nbsp;48 teams, next year and not in 2020.&nbsp;Canada, the United States and Mexico have a joint bid and had&nbsp;initially hoped for fast-track proceedings with a vote in Bahrain&nbsp;but possible other bidders have now been given three months to&nbsp;declare their interest. Many believe the size of the tournament makes rival bids unlikely. &nbsp;mp/jh (Reuters/AP)
