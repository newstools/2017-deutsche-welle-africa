Project goal: Sustainable use of ecosystem services in Jordan. Project implementation: Various projects with the population in the areas of ecotourism and sustainable grazing management. Cooperation with ministries as well as government and non-governmental organisations with the the goal of establishing a national biodiversity strategy. Project partner: German development agency GIZ, Jordanian Ministry of Environment (MoEnv), consulting firm GOPA.A lot of desert, scarce water resources, little arable land: the kingdom of Jordan has difficult living conditions. At the same time, the population is growing, and hundreds of thousands of refugees are seeking solace here as well. Climate change and overgrazing are increasing the pressure on the natural resources - this makes it all the more important to use what nature provides with great care. The GIZ is trying to promote a change in thinking, both among the people as well as in the government.A film by Mabel Gundlach
