A report published on Friday by the US-founded, international non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has revealed that at least two high-ranking officials in Russia's southern region of Chechnya participated in the torture and humiliation of gay men .From February to April "police rounded up men they suspected of being gay, held them in secret locations for days or even weeks, and tortured, humiliated and starved them, forcing them to hand over information about other men who might be gay," HRW said in its report. "Police beat all detainees viciously and repeatedly electrocuted them."Read more: Gay men flee persecution and honor killings in ChechnyaThe report was based on interviews with locals, as well as six former detainees.

The Russian government has received international condemnation for a 2013 law against the public promotion of homosexuality. Activists and legal experts said the new legislation was vague enough to prosecute someone for even mentioning homosexuality in public.dm/jm (AP, dpa)
