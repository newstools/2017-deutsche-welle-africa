Automaker Daimler on Monday broke the ground for a second e-battery production facility in Kamenz, Germany, where its subsidiary Accumotive had already been churning out batteries for the firm's all-electric and hybrid models since 2012.In the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said the carmaker was aiming to be a driving force of change in the automotive industry and in the age of e-mobility.Daimler had said it was willing to pump roughly 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) into a global e-battery production network, with half of the resources going to the new facility in Kamenz.Producing batteries locally was key to long-term success, the company emphasized, as stricter emissions regulations made the switch to e-cars a necessity.Daimler-Accumotive's new factory is to be operational by mid-2018, with the local workforce to gradually grow to roughly 1,000 by 2020.Until 2022, Daimler wants to produce more than 10 all-electric passenger cars.
