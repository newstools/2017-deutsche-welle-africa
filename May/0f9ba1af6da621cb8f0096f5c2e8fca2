She has been&nbsp;accused of spreading "terrorist propaganda," as well as "membership in a terrorist group."Similar&nbsp;charges have been brought against dozens of reporters and journalists in detention in Turkey since the July 15, 2016 failed coup.It remains unclear whether Tolu was working in Turkey in a journalistic capacity, however. Her most recent employment contract was reportedly as a translator with the left-extremist ETHA news agency.Tolu has also reportedly written in the past for the Netherlands-based Firat News Agency (ANF), which the Turkish government accuses of having links to the outlawed terror group PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party).Rift between Germany and TurkeyThe case could inflame&nbsp;tensions between the two countries once more. Ties between NATO allies Germany and Turkey have plunged to a low over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move to tighten his grip on power.The arrest of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who was jailed on terror charges in February, has also contributed to increasingly sour relations between the two states. In Yucel's case, it took Turkish authorities several weeks to grant consular access to the 43-year-old.With the arrest of Mesale Tolu, the known number of German nationals in custody in Turkey has risen to six. Four of those in detention, however, are reportedly dual nationals of Turkey and Germany.
