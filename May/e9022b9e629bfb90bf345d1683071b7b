While in Brussels Thursday US President Donald Trump told European leaders that Germany was being "bad" with its trade arrangements, German media reported on Thursday."The Germans are bad, very bad," Trump was quoted as saying by respected news weekly "Der Spiegel." He was quoted in German and the exact English phrasing was unclear. The German quote could also be translated as "nasty" or "evil"."Look at the millions of cars they sell in the US. Terrible! We'll stop that," Trump said, according to sources inside who spoke with the magazine.Similar complaints against Germany's trade surplus at the Brussels meeting were reported by Bavarian daily "Sueddeutsche Zeitung."Trump reportedly made it clear that the reduction of the US trade deficit was a high priority for him, during a meeting with the President of the EU Council Donald Tusk and President of the EU Commission Jean-Claude Juncker. Other EU leaders joined the meeting later.Juncker reportedly defended the Germans, saying free trade was a good thing for everyone.$64 billion deficit Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2WJD0In 2016, Germany exported goods worth 253 billion euros ($270 billion) more than it imported.This has given rise to criticism by the Trump administration, IMF chief Christine Lagarde and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro accused Germany of exploiting a "grossly undervalued" euro to boost its exports. According to US figures government figures, Germany had a $64 billion trade surplus with the US in 2016. Trump has previouslycondemned German car-makers for importing cars into the US, threatening them with a 35 percent tariff."If you want to build cars in the world, then I wish you all the best. You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax," Trump told German tabloid "Bild" in January in remarks translated into German."I would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that," Trump said.In March Trump signed executive orders to initiate a large-scale review of the causes of the American trade deficits with some of its largest trading partners - including China and Germany - and order stricter enforcement of US anti-dumping laws to prevent foreign manufacturers from undercutting US companies by selling goods at an unfair price.In April Germany's finance minister rejected US claims that Germany's trade surplus was a sign of unfair policies and called on the Trump administration to remain engaged in trade liberalization.Agreements on terrorism, RussiaIn public comments after Thursday's meeting Tusk said the two sides agreed on a number of issues and reaffirmed counter-terrorism cooperation, but clashed on others."We agreed on many areas, first and foremost on counter-terrorism. Some issues remain open, like climate and trade. And I am not 100 percent sure that we can say today - we means the president and myself - that we have a common position, common opinions about Russia," Tusk said.Later in the day Trump met with NATO leaders and repeated calls for members of the military alliance to pay more, saying that payments must make up for "the years lost."Speaking in Brussels at his first NATO summit, Trump said 23 of the 28 NATO allies owed "massive amounts of money" and that this was "not fair to the people and tax payers of the United States."He also urged his NATO counterparts to fight terrorism, and to make the management of immigration a priority."You have thousands and thousands of people pouring into our various countries and spreading throughout, and in many cases we have no idea who they are," he said.
