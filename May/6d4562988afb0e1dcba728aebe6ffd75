It will no longer be the case," Macron said.Calming German concernsDuring their talks, it was expected that the leaders would have discussed one of Macron's most controversial ideas - a shared budget for the 19 countries which use the euro currency.Under his proposal, the move would also include creating a new finance minister for the eurozone. Macron has said such measures would allow for joint investments and help the eurozone better cope with financial crises. The idea has been met with skepticism by some in Germany, Europe's strongest economy, which has faced the biggest share of bailouts for weaker eurozone members.Last week, Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert commented on the subject of eurobonds.&nbsp;"I can tell you that the federal government's dismissive attitude toward eurobonds remains valid," when asked if Germany would back Macron should he push for the creation of such financial instruments. Some German politicians are concerned taxpayers would see themselves as once more having to foot the bill for the rest of Europe - in a critical election year.&nbsp;Read more: Macron wants a New Deal for EuropeOn Monday, Macron aimed to ease those concerns, saying he did&nbsp;not favor the idea of taking on joint responsibility for old debts in the eurozone.
