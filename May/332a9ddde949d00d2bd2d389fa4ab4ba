Greece and its European creditors failed on Monday to agree on the next batch of bailout loans for the cash-strapped country, but officials said the deal should be reached at their next meeting in three weeks.After more than eight hours of talks in Brussels, finance ministers from the single currency bloc and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were unable to secure an agreement on the sort of debt relief measures the Athens government can expect when its current bailout program ends next year.But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of the eurozone finance ministers, told reporters that the disbursement would likely take place "before the summer." He later repeated his prediction on Twitter.Default by JulyGreece could default on its debts in July if it can't repay some 7.3 billion euros ($8.20 billion). To ensure the new bailout funds, the Greek parliament approved pension cuts and tax hikes last Thursday.But for the payment to proceed, the Greek government needs to implement new laws to make the reforms stick, and some have yet to be passed."We have made huge progress on the policy package on which so much work has been done," Dijsselbloem said, adding that certain issues still needed to be addressed."We were very close, just unable to manage it tonight."
