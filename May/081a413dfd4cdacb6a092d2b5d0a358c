By holding the summit on the island of Sicily, Italy had hoped to make Africa the main focus of the annual G7 meeting on Friday and Saturday."Perhaps the choice (to be in) Taormina and Sicily says much about how important our relations are with Africa," Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in opening remarks.Over the past four years, hundreds of thousands of migrants have taken up refuge in Sicily after fleeing war and poverty in their African countries.

Niger is one of the main transit points for African migrants seeking to reach Europe through Libya.Libya is in turmoil with several militia groups fighting for control"Be it Niger, a transit nation, or the countries of origin, it is only through development that we will prevent illegal migration," Issoufou said.French President Emmanuel Macron, who is one of the four new leaders attending the G7 meeting for the first time, said more needed to be done to support countries like Niger. France has more than 4,000 troops stationed across West Africa.G7 plus Africa?Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was quoted by the Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, as questioning the wisdom of sidelining African leaders from such high-profile meetings when the continent was a focus point of issues affecting the world.British charity organization Oxfam referred to the G7's tough stance on migration, which has been strongly influenced by US President Donald Trump, as a "scandal.""This is the scandal of this summit: That G7 leaders could come right here in Sicily on the doorstep of the sea where 1,400 people have drowned this year alone and fly home tonight without doing anything serious about it," Edmund Cairns, Oxfam's policy adviser on humanitarian crises, said.
