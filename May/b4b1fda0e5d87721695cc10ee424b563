A statement posted on Gregg Allman's website Saturday said he had passed away peacefully at his home in Savannah in the US state of Georgia after struggling "with many health issues" for several years.His manager, Michael Lehman, said Allman had succumbed to liver cancer, which he had kept quiet "because he wanted to continue to play music until he couldn't." Allman, who had a liver transplant in 2010, played keyboard and guitar and sang with a rich, growling voice but was known for his gentle manner and long blond hair.His older brother Duane, a legendary guitar player, died in a motorcycle accident in 1971 at the age of just 24. For decades, Gregg continued to front the band, which re-formed several times, merging blues, jazz, country and rock.Lehman said Gregg Allman wished to be buried next to his brother at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, southeast of Atlanta, where the band got its start nearly five decades ago in the late sixties. "That's his wishes," said Lehman.His final album, recorded recently, was scheduled for release in September, Lehman added.Cher and Allman in Hamburg in November 1977Between 1975 and 1977, Greg Allman was briefly married to the actress and singer Cher.
