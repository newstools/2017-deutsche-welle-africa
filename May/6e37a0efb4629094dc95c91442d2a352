Frances's presidential candidates are all too well aware of the importance that their&nbsp;country attaches to Africa and the former colonies. In the middle of a domestic election&nbsp;campaign, Marine le Pen visited the West African state of Chad and&nbsp;Emmanuel Macron went to Algeria.&nbsp;Views on the whys and wherefores of France's Africa policy differ hugely. Incumbent French&nbsp;President Francois Hollande maintains that Frnace does not intervene in Africa to pursue its own interests, nor does it seek&nbsp;to change the rules of African politics or bring about regime change. &nbsp; &nbsp;"France supports Africa because we believe it has great potential," Hollande said.&nbsp;France's presence in Africa is focused largely on&nbsp;its former colonies. During painful process of decolonization in the 1960s and 1970s,&nbsp;"La Grande Nation" never lost sight of its own interests. Use of the French language in the former French territories remains obligatory. There are still two currency unions in existence - the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc - to which a total of 15 African states belong. Currency reserves are held in France's central bank. It is open to dispute whether the CFA offer greater advantages to France or the African&nbsp;states, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Strong linksFrench corporations such as&nbsp;the construction company Bollor , the oil giant Total and the telecoms group Orange maintain a&nbsp;massive&nbsp;presence in the ex-colonies.Stefan Br ne, an expert on Franco-African relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, believes nonetheless that French influence in Africa may be waning slightly, but it is still very much in evidence. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There are still strong links between Paris and the former colonies," &nbsp;he saidFrench companies import commodities from many West and Central African countries, such as&nbsp;uranium ore from Niger and Gabon or cocoa from Ivory Coast.&nbsp; About 9,000 French soldiers are stationed in those countries. Their&nbsp;mandate is to fight terrorists and train African troops.French President Francois Hollande is credited with being a strong advocate on Africa's behalf &nbsp;Philippe Hugon, a French Africa specialist, believes the emphasis in French engagement in Africa is shifting &nbsp;"France is now less involved in trade, finance and investment, but it is&nbsp;maintaining its influence on monetary policy and its&nbsp;military presence," he said.&nbsp;However, the French are facing growing competition. China has established close ties with many African countries and the United States has been&nbsp;also displaying greater commitment to Africa in recent years.&nbsp;Growing EU roleIt costs France a lot of money to maintain its role a as major&nbsp;player in Africa. Military interventions are not cheap, neither is the development aid which France dispatches to Africa. France has its own domestic economic problems and is&nbsp;therefore finding it increasingly difficult to finance its African operations. Another factor is that the 28-nation European Union, of which France is a member,&nbsp;is becoming more active&nbsp;in Africa. The&nbsp;impact on France's own&nbsp;national policy on Africa could be profound, said Stefan Br ne. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"It would mean that part&nbsp;of the Parisian political elite&nbsp;would lose the means to exert&nbsp;influence and I do not think that they wouold be prepared to accept that,"&nbsp;he said.Hollande weclomes the then AU Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to the Elysee summit on peace and security in Africa in December 2013 Several presidents and presidential candidates have promised to reform France's&nbsp;policy on Africa and to move from a position of dominance to that of a partner among equals. In practice, however, such promises have changed very little.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;African politicians, meanwhile, can be heard telling their citizens&nbsp;that their respective countries need to be less dependent on France, the former colonial power. One recent example was President Alpha Conde of Guinea-Conakry, who curerntly holds&nbsp;the presidency of the 55-nation African Union. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We are still closely associated with former colonial power. Let's cut the&nbsp;umbilical cord," Conde said defiantly.But two weeks later, Cond visited Paris and thanked President Hollande for doing so much for Africa.Macron on AfricaEmmanuel Macron, the shooting star of&nbsp;the French election&nbsp;campaign, has been giving&nbsp;the impression every now and again that he wants to change France's policy towards its former colonies. During his trip to&nbsp;Algeria in February, he said that colonialism was a part of French history,&nbsp;a crime against humanity and truly barbaric. "We must face up to this part of our history and apologize to those who were at the&nbsp;receiving end," he said.His remarks were greated with cries of indignation in France and he quickly backpedalled, returning to&nbsp;more a traditional interpretation&nbsp;of France's Africa policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
