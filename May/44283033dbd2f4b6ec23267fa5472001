Rafael Nadal remained on course for a 10th French Open title with a regulation 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Robin Haase in the French afternoon sunshine. The fourth-seeded Spaniard secured the win on Court Philippe Chatrier, where he won his previous nine titles."It was really hard for me last year," Nadal, who had to withdraw because of an injury in 2016, said. "I'm very happy to be back on this court, which is probably the most important in my career."Despite being outclassed, Haase was able to see the funny side of the story. "At the beginning I was way better," the Dutchman said. "Then the warmup ended."Defending champion Novak Djokovic was also smiling after an equally comfortable 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 win over Joao Sousa.
