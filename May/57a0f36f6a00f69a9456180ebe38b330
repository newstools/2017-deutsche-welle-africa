Sofia Solar Cafaggi, 29, says she had never faced problems as a Mexican living in the United States for the last four years.

Despite being offered a scholarship for medical school at a US university, she is going off this fall to the University of Toronto. Donald Trump entering the political arena and the ensuing rhetoric around Mexicans and immigration made Canada especially appealing."It definitely helps make the decision easier to just go back to Canada where in general I feel Canada is a pretty welcoming country," she says. "It's a huge contrast right now."
