"While wild cards exist for players returning from injury, there is nothing for a return from a doping ban."Sharapova's ban expired on April 26 and she was given a wild card to enter the Stuttgart Grand Prix, making it all the way to the semi-finals. Some players were critical of tournament organizers who allowed Sharapova into the tournament without any ranking points.Observers were eager to see if the FFT&nbsp;would take the same approach, with opinions divided among observers.Some believed Sharapova deserved no special treatment in light of her doping ban, while others said she had been adequately punished by the ban itself.mz/jm (AFP, Reuters)
