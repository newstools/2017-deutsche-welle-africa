Chinese auto giant Geely on Wednesday announced it had bought a 49.9-percent stake in Malaysia's carmaker Proton. As part of the deal, the Chinese would also acquire 51 percent of British car manufacturer Lotus from Proton for 51 million pounds ($66.2 million, 59.2 million euros), officials said."With Proton and Lotus joining the Geely Group portfolio of brands, we strengthen our global footprint and develop a beachhead in Southeast Asia, Geely Vice President Daniel Li Donghui said in a statement, adding that the target was for Proton to produce 500,000 cars by 2020 for the Southeast Asian markets.Geely already owns Sweden-based Volvo Car Corporation, which has made a remarkable comeback since it was sold by the Ford Motor Company back in 2010.

With government support, Proton initially dominated the domestic market, but subsequently struggled with making profits as it suffered from a reputation for unimaginative models and shoddy quality.The Malaysian company produced the nation's first national car brand, looking back at a history of more than 30 years."Wednesday's agreement lays the foundation for a wider framework for Geely plus Proton and Lotus to explore joint synergies in areas such as R & D, manufacturing and market presence," Geely commented.hg/jd (AP, AFP)
