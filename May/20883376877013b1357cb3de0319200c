Barnier addressed the Irish parliament on Thursday, saying "if we are open to finding solutions, there is no reason why our strong Europe cannot maintain a strong relationship with the UK."Ireland is an EU member with particularly close ties to the UK given the land border it shares with Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK but will leave the EU once the Brexit is complete.This leaves Ireland facing an uncertain future: currently, Ireland enjoys border-free trade with the UK under the EU's single market. Once the UK leaves the EU, border-free trade is no longer guaranteed.As Barnier pointed out, "customs controls are part of EU border management, they protect the single market, they protect our food safety and our standards."
