After releasing a report on the latest totals of unaccompanied minor refugees on Wednesday, UNICEF called on world leaders to do more to protect children who are crossing borders alone.In 2015 and 2016, the United Nations Children's Fund said there were 300,000 unaccompanied and separated migrant children worldwide. The figure is almost five times higher than the 66,000 children counted in 2010 and 2011.A small group of Afghan teenagers, fearful of being followed by police, set off on the roughly 12-kilometer (seven mile) hike along roads and the dangerous mountain tracks of the Death Pass to France.Migrants and refugees cross the border between the town of Ventimiglia in Italy and Menton in France by walking through the highway tunnels or along railroad tracks or by climbing over the rocky mountain. Whichever way they choose, the journey is sometimes fatal.Many migrants and refugees access the highway that leads to France at this fence. From here they risk their lives walking through the tunnel.Those who opt for the Death Pass generally set off without knowing the route or carrying supplies of food or water.Old farmers' storehouses are used by refugees and migrants as shelter, to rest or to wait for nightfall before they cross the mountain. Worn clothes are left behind when they change into fresh clothes, hoping that a tidy appearance will help them avoid getting caught by the French police.A "pace" flag hanging from the border fence between Italy and France indicates where people can squeeze through. The French government erected the fence after World War II to stop Italian immigration.The teenagers survey the route down to Menton. The highest point of the Death Pass is nearly 300 meters (985 feet). Often the migrants and refugees are caught once they make it to France and sent back to Italy. Author: Federico Scoppa (Ventimiglia) Out of the 300,000 children, around 100,000 of them were caught trying to cross the border from Mexico to the United States, UNICEF said.Around 170,000 young migrants and refugees sought asylum in Europe in 2015 to 2016 after surviving the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. Last year, hundreds of children are believed to have drowned while attempting the journey. The total number of unaccompanied children is believed to be much higher as the UNICEF counts only include solo-traveling children who were registered as part of an asylum claim or registered at a border."The number is just the tip of the iceberg," UNICEF Eeputy Executive Director Justin Forsyth said in a statement.A vulnerable and growing groupWednesday's report also states that from 2016 until February of this year, 92 percent of minors who reached Italy by crossing the Mediterranean from Libya were traveling alone - compared to 75 percent in 2015.The UN body said that the growing numbers of unaccompanied minors are particularly vulnerable human smugglers."Ruthless smugglers and traffickers are exploiting their vulnerability for personal gain, helping children to cross borders, only to sell them into slavery and forced prostitution," Forsyth said."It is unconscionable that we are not adequately defending children from these predators," he added.Ahead of next week's G7 summit in Italy, UNICEF urged world leaders to adopt their six-point agenda improve protections for refugee and migrant children.The agenda calls for countries to stop detaining children, improve efforts to keep families together and give children access to education and healthcare.rs/sms (AP, dpa, Reuters) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/1I3IM
