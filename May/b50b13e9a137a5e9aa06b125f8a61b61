Representatives of the 29-year-old army private - formerly known as Bradley Manning - could not say the exact day she will be released, but a White House statement in January said it would be May 17."Chelsea has already served the longest sentence of any whistleblower in the history of this country. It has been far too long, too severe, too draconian," Manning's attorneys said&nbsp;in a joint statement.Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted in 2013 and had been in custody since being arrested in May 2010.Manning was convicted in a military court martial of 20 counts, including six Espionage Act violations, theft and computer fraud. She - then he - was acquitted of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy.She reportedly tried to commit suicide&nbsp;and went on hunger strikes in the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.Her attorneys said Manning was subjected to violence in prison and argued the military mistreated her by requiring her to serve her sentence in an all-male prison and not allowing her to wear a feminine-style haircut.The Department of Defense has repeatedly declined to comment on Manning's treatment in prison.Chelsea Manning in an undated photo taken during her imprisonmentEmbarrassing leaksA former intelligence analyst in Iraq, Manning was convicted in 2013 of leaking over&nbsp;700,000 secret military and State Department documents and battlefield videos.&nbsp;The episode was one of the most embarrassing leaks of classified information in US history.Three days before leaving office in January, then-president Obama slashed Manning's sentence by 28 years after more than 115,000 people signed a petition calling for her release.Manning acknowledged leaking the materials, saying she wanted to expose the US military's disregard about the effects of war on civilians and said she released information that wouldn't harm the US.Then-Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Md., after the third day of his court martial.Critics said the leaks endangered information sources, prompting the State Department to help some of those people move to protect their safety.Several ambassadors were recalled, expelled or reassigned because of embarrassing disclosures.'Freedom was only a dream'Manning, who began the process of gender reassignment while in custody, said in a statement she can now see a future for herself as Chelsea. "Freedom was only a dream, and hard to imagine. Now it's here! You kept me alive."Her release follows president Barack Obama's order commuting her sentence in January just before he left office.Manning thanked Obama and also said letters of support from fellow transgender individuals and veterans inspired her "to work toward making life better for others."jbh/kl (dpa, AP, AFP)
