In the first half of Borussia Dortmund's German Cup final win over Eintracht Frankfurt, Marco Reus partially tore a cruciate ligament in his right knee and is expected to be out for "several months," his club confirmed on Monday. No specific return date was given, but it looks as though BVB fans may not see their star winger back on the pitch until October at the earliest.Reus was a late arrival for BVB's celebrations through Dortmund's city center because he was in hospital getting examined. This is just the latest in a long line of injuries for the 27-year-old, who missed both the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Euros due to injuries and was not selected in Germany's Confederations Cup this summer in order to give him some much-needed rest.Reus will now spend yet another summer recovering from an injury and there are genuine concerns that the winger's body isn't suitable for football as ligament tears, adductor problems and muscle and ankle issues continue to plague the former Gladbach player. Nevertheless, Reus, who turns 28 at the end of the month, has battled back each time and this season, after a scintillating second half of the campaign, capped it off with the first trophy of his career.
