The reasons people choose to leave Germany after applying for asylum vary. For many, it is not about the financial incentives Germany offers those who want to leave but instead due to reasons of a private nature, such as to care for an ill relative&nbsp;or simply missing family members who were left behind."For some, it's the language, or they just don't get on here," refugee advisor Sanela Selimagic said in Berlin on Thursday. For 10 years, Selimagic has been advising asylum-seekers on behalf of the International Office for Migration (IOM).Read more: Voluntary returns - When asylum seekers want to go homeAccording to IOM, 54,096 asylum-seekers&nbsp;voluntarily left Germany in 2016.&nbsp;By the end of April 2017, around 11,000 had left.Finance and reintegrationIn a bid to increase the number of people choosing to leave Germany, the country's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) and the IOM on Thursday&nbsp;launched www.returningfromgermany.de, a new&nbsp;online portal&nbsp;providing information for those interested in voluntarily&nbsp;returning to their home country.

"A lot of work and research is required for each case, but now it's all in one place, both for the applicant and the adviser.Decrease in voluntary returnsThe launch of the portal on Thursday coincided with the release of a new BAMF report showing that in the first quarter of 2017, the number of refugees who voluntarily returned home was down almost 40 percent compared to the same period of 2016.According to BAMF, between January and March, 8,468 refugees left the country of the own will compared 13,848 returnees over the same time period last year.Germany's government is investigating the reasons for the sharp decline. Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, however,&nbsp;Ole Schr der, a parliamentary state secretary in Germany's Interior&nbsp;Ministry, said&nbsp;the drop in returns could be attributed to the huge influx of refugees who crossed Germany's borders at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015.
