Some 49 percent of interviewees - 10 percent less than in July 2016 - said they have 'strong' or 'very strong'&nbsp;confidence in the German army, or&nbsp;Bundeswehr, with 49 percent expressing 'little or no'&nbsp;confidence, according to a survey for&nbsp;ARD's "Deutschlandtrend" published on Thursday.The fall comes amid concerns of right-wing extremism in the army after right-wing lieutenant Franco A. was arrested at the end of April having registered as a refugee to carry out xenophobic attacks.&nbsp;Prosecutors believe he had compiled a list of German officials to attack, including the&nbsp;former German president, Joachim Gauck, and the current justice minister, Heiko Maas.The affair has also&nbsp;raised questions about how&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany's asylum procedures failed to detect that Franco A. was operating under a false identity as a Syrian refugee.
