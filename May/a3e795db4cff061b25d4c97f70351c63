Tom Dumoulin came from behind to win the 100th edition of the Giro d'Italia on Sunday to become the first ever Dutch winner of the flagship three-week Italian cycle race.Dumoulin, team leader for the Sunweb team, went into the final stage of the race 53 seconds behind overnight leader Nairo Quintana of Colombia. But the 26-year-old clawed back the deficit on the 29.3 kilometer time-trial in Milan to claim his maiden grand tour victory.Watching nervously as Quintana entered the final kilometers of his time-trial, Dumoulin couldn't contain his excitement when the calculations indicated that the Colombian was unlikely to match his time."It's crazy, I don't know what to say," he said. "It's a dream! When I crossed the line people were telling me I'd won, but as I sat here, I was freaking out!""It's incredible, he continued. "I couldn't have imagined this, ever. I was strong, I was lucky and everything fell into the place on this Giro. Now I want to try to win the Tour de France!"Dutch doubleWith his compatriot and close friend Jos van Emden finishing second on the stage finish, the Netherlands have twice as much to celebrate."Tom wins, and I win, finally. There are two really happy people inside this tent," said Van Emden. "This is a great day for Dutch cycling."mf/mp (afp/sid)
