In a TV interview in March, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&nbsp;insisted that the "Houthis and their allies could be rooted out in several days, but the cost would be thousands of dead among our soldiers and losses too high among the Yemeni civilians.""A long war is in our interest," he added.The health situation has been exacerbated by a sanitation workers&nbsp;strike over unpaid wages in the capital Sanaa. As a result of the strike and recent heavy rains, the city has been flooded by sewer water.In Sanaa, the Public Healthy Ministry said it has about 310 suspected cholera cases on its hands.&nbsp;"There have been 34 cholera-associated deaths and 2,022 cases of acute watery diarrhea in nine governorates, including Sanaa, during the period of April 27 to May 7," the World Health Organization told French news agency AFP.According to MSF, the outbreak has forced some cholera victims in remote villages to travel dozens of miles in extremely dangerous conditions in search of care.es/kms (AP, AFP)
