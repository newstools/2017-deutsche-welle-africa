The side's jostled for supremacy as the tension in Cologne's Lanxess Arena ratcheted up a notch or two but neither team made a further breakthrough.As the clock ticked down on the final period, Germany had a big chance with a power play after&nbsp;Nicholas Jensen had to leave the ice for slashing. But they couldn't make the most of it.And it was underdogs Denmark who took the two points,&nbsp;Regin's goal moving them level on points with Slovakia and a point behind their opponents. Germany stay in fifth, with the first four teams in group A to qualify for the last eight, and must beat last-placed Italy on Saturday to stay in the hunt.&nbsp;
