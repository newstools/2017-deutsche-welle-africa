Jan K rbes knows exactly how to build a standard house - but he couldn't care less about normal buildings.When the adventurous German architect/artist decided to build a house of his own five years ago, he wanted to do things differently, starting with the construction material: he envisioned a home made of used, discarded materials.&nbsp;The shell of the house was to be light and transportable, so a cylinder-shaped fodder silo made of polyester and glass fiber suited K rbes just fine. He felt his new home didn't need to be bigger than 6 meters high and 2&nbsp;meters in diameter (about 20 feet by 7 feet).K rbes made clever use of the scant space in the siloThe space has two levels, with the kitchen and bathroom on the ground floor and the bedroom on the first floor. K rbes scrounged for shelves, drawers, doors and other items among discarded furniture on the streets - a tedious undertaking.Everything was fitted so it would match the structure's unusual shape. K rbes had to be quite inventive: the narrow silo left no room for a stairway, so the first floor can only be reached by way of a climbing wall.For a few years now, K rbes and his daughter have been living in the tiny 13-square-meter space. But he says many more people actually fit inside, claiming he once had more than 30 guests over for a party.
