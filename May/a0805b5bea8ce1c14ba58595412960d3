A US judge on Thursday ruled that&nbsp;Mexico's infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman must remain in solitary confinement at a high-security New York City to keep him from attempting to control his nacrotics-trafficking empire.In a written statement, US District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn said that confinement is necessary "to ensure that the defendant cannot coordinate an escape from prison, direct any violence against cooperators or manage any aspect of the Sinaloa cartel's enterprise."Guzman, who was extradited to the US in January, stands accused of leading Mexico's notorious Sinaloa cartel known for major cross-border drug-trafficking operations and violent attacks against rivals and security forces.He has denied allegations that he led a multibillion-dollar international drug trafficking operation that involved brutal assassinations and kidnappings.Since arriving to the US, Guzman has been locked up for 23 hours per days in a 6-by-3.7-meter (20-by-12-foot) cell in Manhattan, which had previously held mafia boss John Gotti&nbsp; and close associates of former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
