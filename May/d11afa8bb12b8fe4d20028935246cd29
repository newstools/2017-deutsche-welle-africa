Walid al-Moallem, Syria's foreign minister, explained the decision regarding the recently-brokered deal involvingfour "de-escalation" zones during a press conference in Damascus on Monday."The Russian side stressed that military police will be deployed and not peacekeepers under the supervision of the United Nations," to oversee the implementation of the deal, al-Moallem told reporters."We do not accept a role for the United Nations or international forces to monitor the agreement," he said while reiterating&nbsp;the government's commitment to the deal.The Syrian official noted that it was "premature" to talk about whether the&nbsp;agreement would be successful, but noted that the government would "harshly" retaliate against any violation by&nbsp;rebels while the deal was in force. Neither&nbsp;the Syrian government nor the opposition have signed the agreement.A spokesman for the UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, declined to comment on the minister's remarks.A shaky agreementRussia, Turkey and&nbsp;Iran&nbsp;struck a deal last week to set up four safe zones where the opposition and government forces will halt hostilities.

The memorandum did not specifically mention the use of military police.Evacuations begin in Damascus suburbMeanwhile on Monday, the evacuation of fighters and their families from&nbsp;the eastern outskirts of Damascus&nbsp;began, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).
