US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be honored to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "under the right circumstances.""If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it," Trump told the New York-based Bloomberg News agency. But the White House later said that the conditions "are not there right now," without providing further details.Both North Korea and Washington have been trading off shows of force over the past few weeks. There are signs that North Korea might be preparing either its sixth nuclear test or a long-range missile launch, and the White House&nbsp;has refused&nbsp;to rule out military action in response.'Ready to respond'Pyongyang warned on Monday that it would&nbsp;conduct a nuclear test at any time determined by its leadership, in the latest comments to fuel already heightened tensions in the region.A spokesman for the North's foreign ministry said the government was "fully ready to respond to any option taken by the US," in a statement carried by the state-run KCNA news agency.North Korea's "measures for bolstering the nuclear force to the maximum will be taken in a consecutive and successive way at any moment and any place decided by its supreme leadership," the spokesman said, apparently referring to a new nuclear test.Last week, China warned that the situation on the Korean peninsula could escalate or slip out of control. South Korea has also regularly warned&nbsp;that the North can carry out a test whenever it chooses to do so.THAAD operationalNorth Korea raises the tone of its threats every spring when the United States and South Korea carry out joint military exercises which Pyongyang views as rehearsals for an invasion.This year, however, fears of conflict have been fueled by a back-and-forth of threats from the Trump administration and Pyongyang.The US military said Monday that a contentious anti-missile system dubbed the Terminal High Altitude Defense (THAAD) is now operational.The deployment of the US missile system in South Korea has prompted concerns from Pyongyang as well as its regional ally, China.On Tuesday, South Korea's Defense Ministry announced that two US B-1B bombers had participated in a joint drill over the Korean Peninsula.Enter JapanJapan dispatched a helicopter carrier, Izumo, from a port south of Tokyo on Monday, which was to join&nbsp;a US supply vessel off Chiba prefecture, according to media reports.It is the first operation of its kind since Japan passed controversial legislation allowing the military to have a greater role overseas.Japanese officials said the US ship is expected to refuel other American warships in the region, including the USS Carl Vinson - a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sent by the US as a show of force.In February, China banned all coal imports from North Korea. Under tight conditions, North Korea may still export $400.87 million (374 million euros) or 7.5 million metric tons of coal per year, whichever is less. Pictured here is China's Liaoning Greenland Energy Coal Co. in Dandong, on the border with North Korea. North Korea is prohibited from opening banks abroad, and UN member states are prohibited from operating financial institutions on Pyongyang's behalf. Any dealings that might help North Korea skirt the sanctions are banned, and UN member states must expel and repatriate anyone working on the regime's financial behalf.This North Korean cargo ship found itself boarded for inspection in the Philippines in March 2016 after the United Nations ordered member nations to de-register any vessel owned, operated or crewed on orders from Pyongyang. North Korean ships also cannot fly the flags of other nations to evade sanctions. Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, remains exempt from aviation sanctions and still has scheduled flights to China and Russia, as well as several domestic routes. However, the airline cannot fly to the European Union, which has banned it on safety grounds, and the United States prevents citizens from legally conducting business with the carrier.In theory, North Koreans can still cruise the country in Pyeonghwa sedans, as UN sanctions only currently ban the sale of aviation, jet and rocket fuel to Pyongyang. Crude and similar oils remain permitted - for now. The automaker, owned in a joint venture with the deceased North Korean Reverend Sun Myung Moon's influential Unification Church, only cranks out a few hundred cars a year.UN sanctions limit North Korea's diplomats abroad - at the country's Berlin embassy, for example - to only one bank account each. North Korea is also not permitted to own real estate abroad for any purposes other than consular.It's a safe bet that North Korea's marching military did not learn its moves abroad: UN sanctions ban foreign security forces from training the country's army, police or paramilitary units. The United Nations does permit medical exchanges, but otherwise allow very little assistance of scientific or technical value.Anyone wanting to own a larger-than-life Kim will have to await the end of North Korea's nuclear program.
