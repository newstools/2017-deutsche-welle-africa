If you were asked to define German style, what would you say?Jokes about wearing&nbsp;socks with&nbsp;Birkenstocks aside, Germany has contributed quite a bit to the design world. From the Bauhaus school's influence on&nbsp;architecture and design&nbsp;since its&nbsp;opening&nbsp;in 1919 to the still-modern&nbsp;fashion designer&nbsp;Jil Sander, German&nbsp;style can be seen and felt around the world.While it may be easy to pinpoint Parisian chic, it seems&nbsp;harder to pin down what it means to be "typically German"&nbsp;in terms of style and design.&nbsp;It's not all Lederhosen and Dirndl in the country,&nbsp;so&nbsp;what, exactly, does German fashion look like? Claudia Schiffer and Heidi Klum? Do Germans&nbsp;really prefer functional clothing over fashion?The development of a unique aestheticThe book "The Germans - Stil und Ikonen einer Nation" is available in GermanA new book published by TeNeues, "The Germans: A Nation's Style and Icons,"&nbsp;seeks to answer the questions many have about German style.&nbsp;Heavy on imagery, it is filled with personal anecdotes from contributors like fashion designer Ayzit Bostan and design journalist Christoph Amend.The book takes a trip through the last several decades of German history, introducing readers along the way to German icons, such as&nbsp;Claudia Schiffer, Boris Becker and&nbsp;Gloria von Thurn and Taxis.From the first cover of German "Vogue"&nbsp;to a travel guide highlighting&nbsp;the nude bathing rituals of former East Germany, the media and publishing artifacts of the past are held up to show the&nbsp;influence they had in their day.&nbsp;Inside the German psycheWriters Silke Wichert and Nina Zywietz also look inside a typical&nbsp;house to trace the meaning of German style.&nbsp;Inside, the writers reveal what&nbsp;lace curtains and&nbsp;wall-sized wooden closets say about the German psyche:&nbsp;privacy and organization play a big role.Some entries are dated,&nbsp;revealing a particular time in history:&nbsp;Schlager star Heino may still be popular and appears not to have aged since the 1980s, but a picture taken with his wife on an exercise bike is definitely old school.&nbsp;In other pictures, those dates are important, conjuring&nbsp;up memories of events that were highly influential to most Germans today. The Scorpions, whose "Wind&nbsp;of Change" song memorably&nbsp;captured the mood in Europe in 1989,&nbsp;get their due.&nbsp;It's an interesting cast of characters assembled in the book, as the writers and contributors share their influences and seek to&nbsp;clarify what makes a German German. The stories that they tell - for example,&nbsp;the way the infamous Stan Smith adidas sneaker came to be so popular - help to create an image of Germany that's rarely been seen before. One in which "The Germans"&nbsp;are fashionable&nbsp;trendsetters.
