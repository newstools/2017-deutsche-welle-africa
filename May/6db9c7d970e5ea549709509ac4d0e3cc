Apple announced it sold 50.76 million iPhones in its fiscal second quarter that ended on April 1, down from 51.19 million units a year earlier.The company argued that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition of the firm's most important product later this year.The next iPhone edition is expected to feature wireless charging, 3D facial recognition and a curved display."There is a general softening in phone demand to contend with as well as expectations of a big upgrade," said James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst.
