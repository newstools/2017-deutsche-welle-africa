The Salt Lake City Police Department in the US state of Utah said it supported an independent criminal investigation of an incident in which a police officer arrested a nurse for refusing to draw blood from an unconscious patient, according to a statement circulated on Saturday."This is an ever evolving situation, and we will do what is necessary to fully investigate the issue, uphold the integrity of the Salt Lake City Police Department and strengthen the trust with our community," said Chief Mike Brown.Video emerged earlier this week of the officer, identified by local media as Detective Jeff Payne, manhandling and detaining nurse Alex Wubbels.Read more: US probe slams Chicago police for 'use of excessive force'"Stop, stop I've done nothing wrong This is crazy, please sir, you're hurting me," Wubbels said as Payne put handcuffs on her.In the video, Wubbels explained that she couldn't draw blood from her patient unless he was under arrest, consented to the blood-draw or the officer had a warrant. Wubbels said those three requirements for a blood-draw had been agreed upon by the hospital and the Salt Lake City Police Department prior to the altercation.'Unacceptable'The incident has prompted outrage across the nation after footage from Payne's body cam and a mobile phone were uploaded to video hosting websites, with rights activists calling it an "unethical arrest."Read more: Donald Trump lifts ban on military gear for police"We cannot allow an incident like this divide our community or taint the good work of SLCPD," said Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski.
