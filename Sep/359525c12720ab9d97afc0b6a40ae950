In her statement, she accused Marietta Slomka of being "biased and totally unprofessional."She wrote Slomka "found common grounds with SPD and the Greens' brazen intolerance and crude arguments," referring to the German political parties.Weidel, an economist, was elected AfD's lead candidate for the forthcoming election, after former leader Frauke Petry decided not to run.She is often regarded as AfD's voice of reason for her knack for sidestepping the racist and xenophobic remarks by her party leaders.
