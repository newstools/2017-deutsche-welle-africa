Tokyo residents were voting on Sunday for the city's assembly in an election that could spell trouble for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Opinion polls predicted a sweeping victory for Governor Yuriko Koike's new party, Tomin First no Kai, or "Tokyoites First" party, as Abe's Liberal Democrats Party (LDP) were buffeted by scandals and gaffes.Abe is suffering from slumping support after years of stability partly because of a scandal over suspected favoritism.Tokyo's elections often set the tone for Japan's national polls and Koike was rumored to be eyeing a return to parliament to run for prime minister.The former newscaster became the first female leader of Tokyo last summer and earned a reformist image after repeatedly clashing with the male-dominated city government.

She enjoys approval ratings of about 60 percent.Koike used to be an LDP member and held key party and Cabinet posts including defense minister. She angered party seniors when she abruptly ran for Tokyo's governor last year, but had never officially left the party until last month to head her own.If Koike's party wins wide support it could fuel speculation that she will make a bid for the nation's top job, though probably not until after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
