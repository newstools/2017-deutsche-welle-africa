Venezuelans largely avoided polls on Sunday to boycott elections for a controversial "Constituent Assembly" that Socialist President Nicolas Maduro says will end the country's debilitating political and economic crises.Despite that, President Nicolas Maduro hailed the turnout as "the biggest vote that the Bolivarian Revolution has seen in the past 18 years."The vote coincided with one of the bloodiest days since protests began. The country was struck with widespread demonstrations, many turning violent, and the shooting deaths of a leading candidate and of a youth opposition leader.Read: What are Venezuela's proposed constitutional changes?Prosecutors believe multiple assailants broke into the house of Jose Felix Pineda, a 39-year-old lawyer, overnight and fired several shots at the candidate, killing him.A regional secretary for the youth opposition party Democratic Action, Ricardo Campos, was also shot dead during a protest against the election in the northeastern town of Cumana, prosecutors said on Sunday.Ten people killed since SaturdayProtesters wearing hoods and masks erected street barricades, which security forces quickly removed. Authorities said 10 people died in the various protests and the opposition said the true death toll was 15. That would make Sunday the deadliest day of protests since they broke out in April.Read more: Venezuela: Democracy under fireProsecutors said a Venezuelan soldier was shot dead at a protest in the western state of Tachira, and two teenagers were killed at different protests in the same region.In Caracas a bomb exploded and injured seven police officers. In what could be a sign of increasingly violent tactics, a makeshift bomb injured several police officers"This is war!" Caracas resident Conchita Ramirez said on television as she described troops firing at buildings and people in the capital.More than four months of opposition-led protests against Maduro have left more than 100 people dead, exposing deep rifts in the oil-rich country suffering from food and medicine shortages.The opposition planned further protests on Monday despite a government ban and prison sentences as high as 10 years for protesters.Opposition leader Henrique Capriles also called for protests on the day that the new assembly takes office, which should happen within 72 hours of Sunday's election results being announced.US condemns voteThe US State Department officially condemned the Venezuelan government for holding the vote, saying it was step toward authoritarian rule.The State Department said in a statement that the new body was designed to "undermine the Venezuelan people's right to self-determination.""We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela, including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly as a result of today s flawed election," it said.US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley earlier tweeted that the vote was a "sham election" which takes Venezuela "another step toward dictatorship."Empty polling stationsThe government claimed that there was a massive turnout, but many polling stations in the capital were reportedly empty, even ones that had been teeming in previous elections.Ruling socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello said that results were still being tallied, but "I can assure you there was record participation."The opposition estimated that participation in the vote was just 7 percent by mid-afternoon, but warned that the government would likely announce that 8.5 million people had voted. By late evening the government announced that 8 million people voted.

Two dozen sources told Reuters they were being threatened with dismissal and were being blasted with text messages and phone calls asking them to vote and report back after doing so.Only 23 percent of Venezuelans favor the new assembly plans, according to a June survey by polling firm Datanalisis.State television showed Maduro casting the first vote in a west Caracas polling station. "I'm the first voter in the country. I ask God for his blessings so the people can freely exercise their democratic right to vote," Maduro said alongside his wife, who is a candidate for the constituent assembly.The 545-member citizens' assembly will be tasked with rewriting the constitution and be empowered to dissolve the opposition-controlled Congress. Congress has already been severely weakened by the Maduro-loyalist electoral commission and Supreme Court. Turnout will be a key factor to give the vote a facade of legitimacy.The US, the EU, the Organization of American States, as well as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico oppose the election, warning it could decapitate Venezuela's democracy and lead to further unrest.aw/jm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
