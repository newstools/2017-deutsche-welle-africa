Britain on Sunday said it would withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention, which allows some other European countries to fish within an area between 6 and 12 nautical miles (11 and 22 km) of its coastline.Triggering the two-year withdrawal period, which is to occur on Monday, is a first move toward Britain's reasserting control over its fishing industry as the country prepares to depart the European Union.

The agreement stands alongside the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which currently allows vessels from EU member states to fish between 12 and 200 nautical miles off the UK.Ireland's agriculture minister, Michael Creed, criticized Britain's decision as "unwelcome and unhelpful."According to government figures, British fishing vessels caught 708,000 metric tons (792,960 US tons) of fish in 2015, worth 775 million pounds (894 million euros, $1 billion). Other members of the convention caught an estimated 10,000 metric tons in British waters.Fishing rights were the subject of heated debate in the runup to the June 2016 Brexit referendum, with British fishermen claiming that EU fishing quotas were damaging the UK industry.
