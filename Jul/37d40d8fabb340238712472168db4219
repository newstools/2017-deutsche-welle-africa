The North's leader, Kim Jong Un, described it as the first of many "gifts" aimed at the US.During a visit to Warsaw earlier on Thursday, Trump suggested that he was considering a "pretty sever" response to Pyongyang's latest act of aggression.Asked whether any potential military action was discussed, Maruyama said that "there is no discussion about the specificity of other measures we could take."Hope for Chinese interventionThe dinner between the three parties came just after Moon held talks Chinese President Xi Jingping, where both sides reportedly backed a UN Security Council resolution to impose tougher sanctions against North Korea.As effectively its only ally, China finds itself under increasing pressure to deal with the reclusive state. While Beijing has backed calls for fresh sanctions, many world leaders above all, Donald Trump have called on it to do more dealing with the crisis.Trump has openly questions China's commitment to dealing with the North, noting on Wednesday the two nations' expanding trade relationship.However, on Thursday the US president indicated he was still hopeful that China would contribute to resolving the crisis, telling reporters he would "never give up" pushing Xi to act.In the meantime, however, Chinese officials have urged all sides to tone down their language. "We also call on relevant parties to stay calm, exercise restraint, refrain from words and deeds that may heighten tensions," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Thursday.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed Tuesday that North Korea test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time. Testing an ICBM marks a major military achievement for Pyongyang and a serious escalation of tensions with the United States and its allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan.Defense experts say the ICBM could reach as far as the US states of Alaska and Hawaii, but questions remain over whether North Korea can field an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead on its cone that could survive reentry into earth's atmosphere. However, North Korean state media said Wednesday the ICBM was capable of carrying a "large, heavy nuclear warhead."The ICBM is believed to be a step forward in the North's nuclear program. Despite pressure from the international community, Pyongyang has made no secret of its nuclear ambitions. Alongside its ritual ballistic missile tests, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on five occasions, two of which in 2016. The country claimed that the last warhead it tested could be attached to a rocket. Apart from a developing missile and nuclear program, North Korea has a powerful army with 700,000 active troops and another 4.5 million in the reserves. It can call upon almost a quarter of its population to serve in the army at any given time. The North's bloated army is believed to outnumber its southern neighbor's by two-to-one.According to the 2017 Global Firepower Index, the North has, as part of a far-reaching arsenal, 458 fighter aircraft, 5,025 combat tanks, 76 submarines, and 5,200,000 total military personnel. The picture above from 2013 shows leader Kim Jong Un ordering strategic rocket forces to be on standby to strike US and South Korean targets at any time.Alongside the United States, Pyongyang views its neighbors South Korea and Japan as its two other main enemies. North Korea has used US military exercises in the region as means of galvanizing its people, claiming that the exercises are dress rehearsals for an impending invasion.Every year, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens role through the streets of the capital Pyongyang to take part in the North's military parades. Preparations for the rallies often begin months in advance and are usually held on an important anniversary of the party or Kim Jong Un's family.Responding to the ICBM provocation with a show of force, the US and South Korean troops on Wednesday conducted "deep strike" precision missile drills using Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and the Republic of Korea's Hyunmoo Missile II. In April, the US sent its Carl Vinson aircraft carrier towards the Korean Peninsula, saying it was taking prudent measures against the North.Mattis: Conflict would be 'catastrophic'While Trump underscored that the Pentagon was drawing up plans for dealing with North Korea, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said on Thursday that he did not believe Pyongyang's ICMB test had brought America closer to conflict."I do not believe this capability in itself brings us closer to war because the president has been very clear, and the secretary of state has been very clear, that we are leading with diplomatic and economic efforts," Mattis said. "As (Winston) Churchill put it, better to jaw-jaw than war-war."While Trump said he was considering a "severe response," Mattis warned that launching a strike on North Korea would come nowhere to destroying its weapons arsenal and prompt Kim to swiftly retaliate with a long-range artillery attack on its southern neighbor.While the US would surely prevail in an all-out conflict, it would "a catastrophic war," Mattis said.dm/bw (dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP)
