It's not meant to be accepted or ... to be negotiated," Sheikh Mohammed said. "The state of Qatar, instead of rejecting it as a principle, we are willing to engage in (dialogue), providing the proper conditions for further dialogue."Egypt said on Sunday that the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Qatar."At the invitation of Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, there will be a quartet meeting of the foreign ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in Cairo on Wednesday July 5 to follow up on the developing situation regarding relations with Qatar," Egypt's foreign ministry spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid, said in a statement.Threat of 'divorce'The demands, announced on June 22, include calls on Doha to end its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, to close the Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera, to reduce diplomatic ties with Iran - regarded by most Gulf states as a regional foe - and to shut down a Turkish military base in the country.Last week, the United Arab Emirates threatened Qatar with "divorce" from its Gulf neighbors if it failed to meet the demands, saying they were non-negotiable.The group behind the demands also includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt.
