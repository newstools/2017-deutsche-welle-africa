I will propose to reduce by a third the members of the constitutional assembly," Macron said, while stressing he was "not giving in" to a sense of anti-parliamentarianism."We need long-term perspective, but we must also act quickly and swiftly, therefore the shuffle between the two houses of parliament must be simplified," he said. "The pace of designing laws must meet the demands of society," he added, citing digital copyright and security as areas where rapid legislative responses were needed.No dragging of feetTo ensure that there would be action, Macron proposed a referendum if parliament had not voted reforms into law within a year."I want... us to avoid half-measures and cosmetic arrangements," he said. "These reforms will be submitted to a vote in parliament but, if necessary, I will have recourse to a vote by our fellow citizens in a referendum."Opinion: Emmanuel Macron's purges in ParisMacron also suggested some "simple" bills should be voted upon in parliamentary commissions, rather than full sessions.

He has also allocated 50 million euros ($56 million) to fight terrorism in Africa's Sahel region,which is seen as a breeding ground for extremists.In a lengthy preamble to his proposals, Macron made references to French history and stressed the need "to identify what needs to be corrected, amended and rectified." The 39-year-old said he would follow three principles: efficiency, representation and responsibility.The event was attended by members of the Senate as well as the newly-elected National Assembly.The venue of the speech - the former seat of French kings - has caused some consternation, with critics citing it as evidence of a growing concentration of power.
