Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said Saturday that the 13 conditions imposed on Doha by Saudi Arabia and four of its allies to lift a month-long blockade on Qatar could not be - and were not intended to be - met."Everyone is aware that these demands are meant to infringe the sovereignty of the state of Qatar," Al-Thani told a press conference in Rome after meeting his Italian counterpart, Angelino Alfano.The demands - announced on June 22 and expiring on Sunday - include ending Doha's support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the closure of the Al-Jazeera broadcaster, reducing diplomatic ties with Iran and shutting down a Turkish military base in the country.Read more: Al-Jazeera: A popular broadcaster on a missionLast week, the United Arab Emirates threatened Qatar with "divorce" from its Gulf neighbors if it failed to meet the demands, saying they were non-negotiable.Along with the UAE, that group includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt.
