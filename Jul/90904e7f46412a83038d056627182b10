Emirates airline announced Wednesday that it had won an exemption from a US ban on passengers taking laptops and tablet computers on flights from its base in Dubai, which has grown into the world's busiest airport for international traffic.The laptop ban had triggered a fall in demand for Emirates' US-bound flights and in May the airline reduced services to five of the 12 US airports it serves.But an airline spokesman assured passengers that "the ban on electronic devices has been lifted with immediate effect for flights to destinations in the United States."Emirates is now the third carrier after neighboring Abu Dhabi's Etihad and Turkish Airlines to win a reprieve from the new rules Washington imposed without warning three months ago on direct flights from 10 airports in eight foreign countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey.The incredibly shrinking banThe bans were put into place after intelligence officials learned of efforts by so-called "Islamic State" (IS) jihadists to produce a bomb that could be secreted inside such devices and taken aboard aircraft. As a result all electronic devices larger than a mobile phone had to be transported in checked luggage.Etihad was the first airline to meet the new US security requirements, with its exemption starting on Sunday.Turkish Airlines followed earlier on Wednesday after new security measures were taken. These include highly sophisticated tomography devices for X-ray and ultrasound screening of carry-on luggage.The first Turkish Airlines flight affected by the ban's removal was its 6.45am flight to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, the Dogan news agency reported.Additionally, Saudi Arabian Airlines expects its laptop ban to be lifted no later than July 19, according to their state news agency.
