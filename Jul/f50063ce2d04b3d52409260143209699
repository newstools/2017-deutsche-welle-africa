In a message from the Vatican on Tuesday, Pope Francis praised the work of the news service for migrants, a partnership between three major European media outlets including Deutsche Welle."I am close with affection and encouragement to those institutions, associations and individuals who open up wisely to the migratory phenomenon with interventions of support, bearing witness to the human and Christian values that are the base of European civilization," Pope Francis said.The Infomigrants portal , co-financed by the European Union, is published in French, Arabic and English and is aimed at migrants "to counter misinformation at every point of their journey," and provide "verified and balanced information" to help them avoid being tricked by people smugglers.Risky journeysMore than 100,000 migrants have made a sea crossing to Europe this year alone, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday. Nearly 2,250 have died in the attempt.Responding to the papal message, DW Director General Peter Limbourg said: "We are pleased to receive the encouragement of the Holy Father," and added: "We can not be indifferent to the fate of millions of refugees and migrants."Limbourg emphasized that InfoMigrants was not a refugee aid project but a channel for news and factual information: "With InfoMigrants we have succeeded in launching a European media project across national borders," Limbourg said. "We want to help people but also to educate them about the dangers and indicate the route to legal migration."Migrants arriving by boat in Salerno, ItalyMigration as opportunitySpeaking about Infomigrants.net, Pope Francis said "I wish to express my sincere appreciation for this important initiative and I hope that, on one hand, it helps the integration of these people with a dutiful respect of the laws of the countries that receive them, and, on the other, that it raises within society renewed commitment for an authentic culture of reception and solidarity."In his message, Pope Francis said that migration was an opportunity, not just a problem. "The presence of so many brothers and sisters who experience the tragedy of immigration is an opportunity for human growth, for encounter and for dialogue between cultures, in view of the promotion and peace and fraternity between peoples," Pope Francis said.

More than 9,000 migrants have landed in Greece, 6,500 in Spain and 270 in Cyprus in the first six months of the year, according to the UN."This is not sustainable.
