Despite British Prime Minister Theresa May's insistence that the UK will not seek to remain in the EU's single market or customs union once it leaves the European Union, several EU diplomats believe a softer Brexit option is likely to emerge now that negotiations have begun between UK and EU officials.The Guardian newspaper on Saturday cited unnamed diplomats from larger EU states who said they have started to review whether the UK will reverse its Brexit decision altogether in light of last month's snap general election result.

Despite a deal with a small Northern Irish party to regain her majority, some pundits question whether May will survive as prime minister, or whether another early election may be held.Change of heart?The British newspaper said the envoys think that May's failure to win a strong mandate has left Britain in a weaker negotiating position that could force a new approach, amid ongoing frustration across the bloc over a lack of a clear UK plan.Formal Brexit negotiations began on June 19 and are expected to follow a two-year timeframe set out by Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty"It is is very inconvenient in my job that I cannot tell my capital what kind Brexit either of the main parties wishes to pursue," one ambassador told the paper, in reference to both the ruling Conservative and main opposition Labour parties still touting the prospects of a so-called hard Brexit."There is no clear information, just information on what politicians will not accept, the unnamed envoy added.Read more: The Brexit Diaries: 1 - the startThe Brexit Diaries: 2 - ambition, clarity and more patriotismMay in the wayThe comments were published on the same day that Brexit Secretary David Davis' former chief of staff warned that the minister's negotiating hand with Brussels was being undermined by May's lack of "flexibility."

Last week, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch uble said he hoped Britons would realize they "made a mistake" over Brexit. Sch uble said he hoped the EU would perform "so well" it would lead UK voters to change their mind.And on Saturday, Italy's EU Minister Sandro Gozi told Britain's LBC radio that "Rome is not ruling out" a British U-turn. Gozi said the prospect was not for "a hard or soft Brexit" but "a weak Brexit," adding that Britain had been left in a dramatically weakened position by last year's referendum.
