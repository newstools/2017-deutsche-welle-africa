"Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (above) said in a statement Monday night.The failure to pass the bill marks a humiliating defeat for Republicans, who have sought desperately to fulfill President Donald Trump's campaign pledge to dismantle the 2010 health-care reforms of his predecessor Barack Obama. Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the upper chamber, giving the party a slim two-seat majority over their Democratic colleagues. McConnell had needed at least 50 of his Republican senators to support the "Trumpcare" bill. But Republican senators Mike Lee (Utah) and Jerry Moran's (Kansas) late Monday announcement that they would join Senators Susan Collins (Maine) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) in opposing the bill effectively killed any remaining chance for the legislation to be passed. A vote had been expected as early as next week.McConnell already had delayed the vote on the bill in the previous days due to the Senate absence of Republican John McCain (Arizona) who is recovering from surgery and whose vote would have been needed to pass the proposed repeal-and-replace legislation. After Lee and Moran's announcements, McCain himself called for a new start on the initiative.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan federal financial analysis agency, had yet to provide the figures for the cost and the number of potentially uninsured Americans that the now-dead bill would have caused. However, the CBO's review of an earlier draft found that the proposed changes would have caused 22 million Americans to become uninsured by 2026, with some low-income individuals priced out of being able to afford health insurance. The reason for the CBO's postponement was not known.Moving fowards by going backwards?McConnell revised the bill last week as he attempted to navigate a tricky divide within the Republican party and win support from critical senators who had been holding out on a "yes" vote either because the bill went too far or did not go far enough.The bill's main points included repealing the tax penalities on individuals who do not buy insurance and cuts to federal funding of Medicaid, which helps cover health-care costs for the poor and disabled. It would have kept Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, but eliminated them on insurers, medical device manufacturers and others.In light of the current bill's failure, McConnell said the Senate would now press for a vote on a bill first proposed in 2015 that would repeal Obamacare within two years. The later date would give lawmakers time to create replacement measures that would kick in when the two years were up. However, such a straight-up repeal bill would likely face substantial opposition, given that the CBO said the 2015 bill's proposed changes would leave an even higher number of Americans - 32 million - uninsured by 2026 than the version that just failed. Demonstrators vent their anger at a New York rally in January against the initial plans to repeal ObamacareCriticsAfter the bill's kiss of doom, President Trump took to Twitter to call for Congress to proceed with a straight-up repeal that would, he said, bring Democrats on board.The Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, described Monday's failure of "Trumpcare" as "proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable."However, in his statement the Senate minority leader did not rule out the possibility of working with Republicans on future health-care legislation."Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our health-care system," he said.Opponents in the Senate had claimed that Republicans were using the repeal of Obamacare as an excuse to end Medicaid. Concern had mounted that the amended bill would also have hiked health costs for people with pre-existing conditions.A Washington Post poll released Sunday showed Americans preferred Obamacare to the Republican plan by 50 percent to 24 percent. Proponents of the bill believe it would give Americans more choice, greater control and lower costs.
