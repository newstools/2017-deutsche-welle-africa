An initiative by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Wednesday resulted in the signing of a landmark treaty aimed at cracking down on international tax avoidance.OECD chief Angel Gurria called the agreement among almost 70 nations "a turning point in the history of tax treaties."German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch uble said the fight against dubious tax arrangements by international companies could only be won by concerted action involving the international community.Signatories include the EU's 28 member countries, but also India, China and Australia. By contrast, the United States did not ink the treaty, confirming its longstanding misgivings about multilateral accords and perhaps due to difficulties of ratification in the Senate, the "Financial Times" argued.Better deal for taxpayersThe newspaper pointed out Wednesday's treaty was part of an initiative launched by the G20 group of leading nations to tackle base erosion and profit shifting, that is tax avoidance strategies involving the shifting of profits to low or no-tax jurisdictions.
