The non-governmental organization Peace Now said Thursday that plans for more than 3,000 units had been advanced this week in West Bank's Jewish settlements.The organization said the Israeli government on Tuesday approved construction of some 1,500 houses, with the possibility to add another 900, on the territory. In a separate process, 688 homes were advanced by a defense ministry committee on Wednesday.Israeli authorities were not available to comment immediately on the Peace Now report.If confirmed, the construction plans would be the first major approval by Israeli authorities since US President Donald Trump requested Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February "hold back on settlements a little bit."It is also not clear whether Israel informed Washington about the plans beforehand.Netanyahu on Tuesday reiterated that settlement construction in the West Bank would continue, but he added that no one would be "uprooted from his home."

The United Nations also considers them a major impediment in peace efforts between Israel and Palestine.shs/sms (AP, AFP)
