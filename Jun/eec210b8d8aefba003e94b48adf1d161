German lawmakers have passed a series of laws concerning the deportation, monitoring and access to personal data of asylum seekers. The new legislation has been met with sharp criticism. (19.05.2017) A Nuremberg court has freed a 20-year-old Afghan being held in custody while awaiting deportation. His arrest was resisted by 300 fellow students, but it remains unclear whether he will be allowed to stay in Germany. (01.06.2017) The German government wants to toughen how it deals with asylum seekers, but critics and experts say that deportation is often cruel and costly. This issue made for a heated debate in the Bundestag on Thursday. (23.03.2017) Within the first four months of the year, the German government has deported a significantly lower number of migrants compared to last year, according to a German newspaper report on Saturday.Citing information from Germany's federal police, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported that by the end of April, a total of 8,620 rejected asylum-seekers had been sent back to their countries of origin. The figures indicated a marked stagnation compared to last year, which saw a total of 25,375 deportations.This year has also seen fewer numbers of rejected asylum-seekers who voluntarily opted to return to their countries of origin. According to police figures, only 11,195 such voluntary return trips were approved during the first four months of the year.In 2016, a total of 54,006 migrants took advantage of the volunteer return program in Germany, which covers certain costs including travel expenses.German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a "national effort" last year to encourage rejected asylum-seekers to return to their home countries.'Lack of cooperation' with some countriesAfter the recent drop-off in the number of refugee and migrant arrivals in Germany, Merkel and the premiers of Germany's 16 states declared that only those whose applications were approved were allowed to stay while all others "should leave Germany."A spokeswoman with the German interior ministry told Welt am Sonntag that the reason for the lower repatriation figures is that an exceptional amount of people returned to their countries of origin last year."Repatriations and voluntary departures in 2016 took place to a particularly large extent in the west Balkan countries," the speaker said.Repatriations to other areas have proven to be much more difficult due to a "lack of cooperation" with other countries, the interior ministry said.The state interior ministry of Hesse told the newspaper that deportations to northern African countries have failed in the past due to the fact that some of the rejected asylum-seekers do not have travel documents.The deportation of rejected asylum-seekers from Germany has sparked several protests and political debates, particularly for those being sent back to Afghanistan. The German government had been sending Afghans back to supposed "safe" regions within their homeland. Following this week's deadly bombing in Kabul, Merkel announced on Thursday that Germany would be temporarily suspending all deportations to Afghanistan.rs/bw (AFP, epd, KNA) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2e4ut
