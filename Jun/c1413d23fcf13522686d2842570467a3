Protected natural sites are vital for biodiversity and wildlife, but harmful industrial activities and unsustainable management are pushing some of these wonders toward the edge of the abyss.A devastating forest fire has drawn international attention to Spain's national park Do ana - but this is only a spark of the ongoing drama in the area. This UNESCO World Heritage site is struggling to survive other pressures, such as intensive and illegal farming.But Do ana isn't an exception in Europe. Environmental activists have recently been stepping up campaigns to protect areas as iconic as Europe's last remaining primeval forest in Poland, or essential habitat for brown bears in Bulgaria.Conservation progress attained in Europe over the past decades is in danger of being reversed, if required management and political will are not galvanized to prioritize long-term ecological benefits over short-term economic ones.Threats to Europe's natural wondersDespite strong conservation legislation in the European Union, over half of Europe's natural areas are not properly protected, according to a recent WWF report.The EU's Natura 2000 is the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world, and covers one-fifth of the land area in the EU. But much of this protection remains only on paper."The legal protection of these areas is of good quality - but it is not properly implemented by all EU members," Sabien Leemans, senior biodiversity policy officer with WWF, told DW.Many Natura 2000 sites are under threat by unsustainable tourism, industrial activities or intensive agriculture, Leemans explained.Although outlawed, that takes place due to a lack of law enforcement, effective management and necessary funding - both from national governments and from the European Commission.Unsustainable activities threaten wonders of nature like Plitvice National Park in CroatiaDo ana: an extreme caseThe wetland complex in southern Spain is among Europe's most important areas for migratory birds, and is home to endemic species such as the imperial eagle or the endangered Iberian lynx (the world's rarest feline).Do ana also supports socioeconomic development of the area - it produces, for instance, 70 percent of strawberries nationally.But water in the region is 80 percent lower than its natural level three decades ago, due mainly to unsustainable water use for intensive farming - which is illegal, in many cases.Do ana marshlands are drying out quicklyCritically endangered birds that were once usual visitors in Do ana are now almost gone.The devastating forest fire started this past Saturday was not a surprise for environmental activists - who have been warning of the risk for a decade."Intensive and illegal farming and a lack of an adequate management make this area even more vulnerable to devastating fires," Juan Romero, spokesperson for the Spanish group Ecologistas en Acci n (Ecologists in Action) in Do ana, told DW.The Spanish government has not reacted to previous EU and UNESCO warnings, he added. This natural disaster might, at least, serve to get some recognition of the problem, Romero hopes.The forest fire in Do ana has forced evacuation of a breeding center for Iberian lynx UNESCO's natural heritage sites at risk Elsewhere in Europe, the Bulgarian government this past March gave the green light to a draft plan to increase by 10 times construction areas within Pirin National Park, home to grey wolves and the rarest woodpecker in Europe, among many other species.WWF warns that such a decision goes against national law, as well as UNESCO recommendations.Meanwhile, in Warsaw last Saturday, hundreds protested against a large increase of logging areas in the Bialowieza Forest. This came several days after environment minister Jan Szyszko called to strip the forest of its UNESCO natural heritage status.Logging started in parts of Poland's oldest forest about a year agoThe Croatian Plitvice Lakes National Park, a network of turquoise waters in a dramatic mountainous landscape, has joined the list.Mass tourism and planned construction projects are threatening the existence of this natural paradise at stake. Its main symbol, the Great Waterfall, is running almost dry."The waterfall has 60 percent less water than it used to," Leemans highlighted. What is failing?

The origin of the name, which means "three-headed," is disputed. Some attribute it to the mountain's three-peaked appearance from certain angles. Others claim a Slavic deity of the same name has his throne at the summit. If so, he must have a breathtaking view of its forested slopes, and meadows strewn with wildflowers.Protected for centuries as a hunting ground for Polish and then Russian monarchs, Bialowieza National Park retains the last of Europe's primeval lowland forest. Under royal patronage, its native bison were hunted to extinction by the early 20th century. But they have since been reintroduced, and several herds thrive in the ancient woodland.Saxon Switzerland National Park lies on the German border with the Czech Republic. For creative inspiration, you could follow in the footsteps of German romantic painters who captured the park's sculptural rock formations. The Malerweg - or "Painter's Path" - consists of 112 kilometers (70 miles) of hiking trails that lead through otherworldly sandstone columns, crags and canyons.In Greek mythology, Typhon - father of all monsters - battled with Zeus until the king of the gods trapped him under Mount Etna. The lava that spits and bubbles from Europe's most active volcano might have you believe Typhon is still waiting for his furious revenge. But volcanoes also make for fertile soils, so Etna National Park is home to some of Sicily's lushest, vineyard-scattered landscapes.More than a million visitors per year flock to Croatia's Plitvice National Park to see its network of 16 lakes linked by waterfalls, and the travertine limestone they have carved into undulating steps. It also provided a dramatic location for the Winnetou films - Germany's own cowboy movies based on the books of Karl May.A range of the Western Carpathian Mountains, the Tatra Mountains span national parks in Poland and Slovakia. Brown bear, lynx, wolves, chamois and marmots are among the fauna at home in its dense forests and alpine meadows. Its majestic birds of prey - including the lesser spotted eagle - have perhaps the best view of these soaring peaks and glistening lakes.Walter Scott penned his poem "Lady of the Lake" in Trossachs. Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park provide plenty of inspiration for such an epic. Osprey skim the surface of its countless freshwater lakes in search of salmon, while Iron Age hut circles, standing stones, a Viking graveyard, and the remains of crannogs - ancient manmade islands - tell tales of Scotland's distant past.Gran Paradiso was Italy's first national park, founded in 1920 to protect the Alpine ibex - then on the brink of extinction. Today, visitors have a fair change of spotting the impressively horned goats in the park's elevated meadows. The bearded vulture, reintroduced 100 years after the last of its species was shot in the park in 1912, looks set to become another restoration success story there. Author: Ruby Russell
