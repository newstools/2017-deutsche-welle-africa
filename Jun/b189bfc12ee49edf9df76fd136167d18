"I had the shakes. I felt terrible for the people inside. I didn't know what was going on. It was a horrible sight."I hope the guys got out okay. It was a horrific scene. I've never seen a plane crash, blimp crash, anything like that. It was pretty awful.""I was sitting on the seventh tee and my caddie goes, 'Look at that thing, just blew up.'

So I saw it fluttering down through the sky."A statement from the United States Golf Association confirmed details of the crash and said the blimp was not affiliated with the tournament or the US Open broadcast."First responders were quick to arrive at the scene and the pilot is currently being treated for unknown injuries," a statement said.
