A gunman rampaged through a casino in the Philippines capital, torching gaming tables and stuffing a backpack with gambling chips, before committing suicide by setting himself on fire, police said on Friday.Hundreds of people fled in panic as fire and plumes of smoke rose from the Resorts World hotel, which went on lockdown as police searched for the gunman who was later found dead in the hotel. "He burned himself inside the hotel room 510," national police chief Ronald dela Rosa told a media conference. "He lay down on the bed, covered himself in a thick blanket and apparently doused himself in gasoline."At least 34 bodies were later found and most of them had died of suffocation, police said. Most of the bodies were found on the second and third floors in the casino area.More than 50 people were also injured, with some reportedly jumping out of the multi-story building to avoid smoke and fire. Police said the incident appeared to be a robbery gone terribly wrong and the gunman did not shoot at people."It's either he lost in the casino and wanted to recoup his losses or he went totally nuts," Metropolitan Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said.Authorities ruled out terrorism at a time the Philippine army is engaged in a second week of fighting against militants affiliated with the "Islamic State" in the southern city of Marawi.But witnesses cited by local ABS-CBN News said they saw multiple gunmen.IS claimed credit for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which cited a militant claiming that "lone wolf soldiers" had carried out the attack.IS has often taken responsibility for isolated acts of violence it did not carry out as a way to feed their propaganda and bolster their image.
