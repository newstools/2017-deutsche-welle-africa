Germany 7-0 San Marino (Draxler 11', Wagner 16', 29', 85', Younes 38', Mustafi 47', Brandt 72')Sandro Wagner marked his first competitive start for Germany with a hat-trick as the world champions made light work of semi-professional San Marino to remain in control of their World Cup qualifying group.As coach Joachim L w continues to use the off season internationals to trial Germany s young and peripheral squad players, Sandro Wagner seized his chance with a treble that should mean he starts Germany s first game in the Confederations Cup on June 19 against Australia in Sochi.Wagner, who s had to wait until the age of 29 to get his chance on the international stage, combined well with Bayern Munich s Joschua Kimmich, who supplied the assist for two of Wagner s three goals as the pair continue to show an understanding that L w will hope they can build on in Russia.On a balmy night in Nuremberg, it was captain Julian Draxler who opened the scoring, finding a gap in the San Marino defence to thread his shot towards the far post.Germany remain two points clear of Northern Ireland at the top of Group C.Wagner s header made it two and the Hoffenheim striker notched up number three soon after, sweeping the ball in from close range after Amin Younes, also given a start, touched it into his path after a quick freekick caught the visitors napping.Younes got on the scoresheet himself with a simple finish after the San Marino keeper fumbled Kimmich s corner. Sandro almost completed his hattrick in the first half but could only find the frame of the goal when he tried to squeeze his shot inside the near post.Germany showed no mercy to their lowly opponents when Shkodran Mustafi made it five with a grubby finish from close range after Draxler s corner wasn t cleared, before Julian Brandt joined the part with a diving header; Kimmich again with the assist.Kimmich, superb throughout, then spotted the run of Wagner and placed the ball perfectly on his head, and the Hoffenheim forward simply glanced it in to bring up his hattrick goal, and complete a satisfying night both for him and L w s unfamiliar side.As it happened:
