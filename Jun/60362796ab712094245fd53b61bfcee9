Germany's Federal Court of Justice on Thursday rejected a claim for compensation from a 67-year-old woman who was given faulty silicone breast implants from a French company that was certified as a safe provider by a German firm.The plaintiff, a 67-year-old pensioner from Ludwigshafen, demanded 40,000 euros ($44,700) in compensation from T V Rheinland after the implants caused her health problems and had to be removed.She had received the implants - manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) - in 2008, but had them removed four years later.Read more: European court rules women have little chance of compensation over faulty breast implantsLittle justice for victimsPIP, which is now insolvent, used industrial-grade silicone in its implants. Although its owner was sentenced to prison for fraud, his bankrupt company couldn't pay damages. Instead, the plaintiff sued T V.Globally, tens of thousands of women are thought to have had the leak-prone silicone breasts implantedThe German court found that T V, a safety certification company headquartered in Cologne, didn't violate any of its obligations.

More than 5,000 women in Germany received them, while around 30,000 procedures were carried out in France.Although the silicone used has not been found to be toxic or carcinogenic, leaks can lead to the formation of scar tissue, changing the shape of the breast, and can cause irritation and inflammation.
