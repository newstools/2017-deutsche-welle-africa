"I have been detained in Igdir for not publishing a correction from [Energy Minister and son in law of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan] Berat Albayrak that included an insult to Aydinlik," said Yucel in a Twitter message.Bulent Tezcan, a member of parliament and spokesman for the main opposition People's Republican Party (CHP), called for Yucel's immediate release on Saturday."Turkey is experiencing one of the darkest, most oppressive periods in its press history," Aydinlik quoted Tezcan as saying.Since a failed coup attempt in July, Erdogan has cracked down on many opposition figures, including politicians, academics, journalists, police and judges.
