A 50-year-old man was killed when his car was struck by a tree in the town of Uelzen in Lower Saxony, as the German weather service DWD confirmed that a tornado had caused widespread damage across northern Germany.A cyclist was also severely injured by another tree nearby as the atypical weather pattern hit the region.Meanwhile, an 83-year-old woman died at Gifhorn, also in Lower Saxony, after her car hit a tree which had been blown across the street in strong gales, police said.The fire brigade was called to help in 250 different incidents in and around the major port city of Hamburg, while the eastern city of Magdeburg lost power in some areas. There were also reports of livestock being killed in weather-related incidents in some rural areas.Music fans, meanwhile, had to seek shelter at the venue of a music festival near the city of Bremen that, ironically, is named "Hurricane."Transportation standstillGerman rail operator Deutsche Bahn has had to shut down several lines in the north of the country after strong winds blew trees and branches onto the tracks.Deutsche Bahn said on Twitter that some of its busiest routes connecting Hamburg with Berlin, Hanover and Wolfsburg would remain closed until the tracks were cleared.Commuter trains in northern Germany were also affected by the shift in weather.Some planes departing from Berlin were temporarily grounded at both of the capital's airports amid heavy rain.More bad weather expectedThe DWD has warned that more gale-force winds, strong rain, lightning and hail can be expected as a low-pressure front approaches northern Germany from the west. While the tornado only hit ground briefly, the DWD did not rule out further instances of tornadoes."The best [thing to do in these cases] would be to go into the cellar and definitely not to stand in front of doors and windows," said Andreas Friedrich of DWD, adding that people should also not use cars as they could turn into "death traps."ss/cmk (AP, AFP, dpa)
