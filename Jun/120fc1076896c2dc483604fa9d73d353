American college student Otto Warmbier was released and evacuated from North Korea on Tuesday after being held captive in the reclusive state for 17 months.Warmbier's release came on the back of a rare diplomatic intervention in the nuclear-armed state, after the US State Department's special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, travelled to Pyongyang to demand his freedom on "humanitarian grounds."Read more: Ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman heads to North Korea 'to open the door'US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the State Department had "secured" Warmbier's release, adding that his agency was pushing for three more Americans imprisoned in North Korea to be freed. It was not clear whether the US had been forced to make any concessions.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also said it was "just too soon to say" whether Warmbier's release could lead to more dialogue by Washington and Pyongyang.Warmbier, a 22-year-old undergraduate student at the University of Virginia, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by North Korea's Supreme Court in March 2016 after tearfully confessing to trying to steal a political banner from a hotel.Warmbier in a comaFollowing the evacuation, Bill Richardson, a veteran former diplomat who has played a role in past talks with North Korea, revealed after speaking to Warmbier's parents that the student had been in a deep coma for more than a year and "urgently needs proper medical care in the United States."According to US media, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, Otto's parents, were told by North Korea officials that their son had suffered from botulism following his trial and fell into a coma after taking a sleeping pill.Read more: Can North Korea's elites oust Kim Jong Un?In a statement, the family said: "We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalized and terrorized by the pariah regime. We are so grateful that he will finally be with people who love him."Richardson said that US officials had only found out about Warmbier's condition a week earlier and that "in no uncertain terms, North Korea must explain the cause of his coma."In February, China banned all coal imports from North Korea. Under tight conditions, North Korea may still export $400.87 million (374 million euros) or 7.5 million metric tons of coal per year, whichever is less.

North Korea is prohibited from opening banks abroad, and UN member states are prohibited from operating financial institutions on Pyongyang's behalf. Any dealings that might help North Korea skirt the sanctions are banned, and UN member states must expel and repatriate anyone working on the regime's financial behalf.This North Korean cargo ship found itself boarded for inspection in the Philippines in March 2016 after the United Nations ordered member nations to de-register any vessel owned, operated or crewed on orders from Pyongyang. North Korean ships also cannot fly the flags of other nations to evade sanctions. Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, remains exempt from aviation sanctions and still has scheduled flights to China and Russia, as well as several domestic routes. However, the airline cannot fly to the European Union, which has banned it on safety grounds, and the United States prevents citizens from legally conducting business with the carrier.In theory, North Koreans can still cruise the country in Pyeonghwa sedans, as UN sanctions only currently ban the sale of aviation, jet and rocket fuel to Pyongyang. Crude and similar oils remain permitted - for now. The automaker, owned in a joint venture with the deceased North Korean Reverend Sun Myung Moon's influential Unification Church, only cranks out a few hundred cars a year.UN sanctions limit North Korea's diplomats abroad - at the country's Berlin embassy, for example - to only one bank account each. North Korea is also not permitted to own real estate abroad for any purposes other than consular.It's a safe bet that North Korea's marching military did not learn its moves abroad: UN sanctions ban foreign security forces from training the country's army, police or paramilitary units. The United Nations does permit medical exchanges, but otherwise allow very little assistance of scientific or technical value.Anyone wanting to own a larger-than-life Kim will have to await the end of North Korea's nuclear program. The UN sanctions currently ban the sale of statues by the nation.White House dismisses Rodman role in releaseWarmbier's release coincided with a visit to reclusive state by former basketball player Dennis Rodman, likely to be the only mutual friends shared by both US President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.Rodman a former contestant on Trump's Celebrity Apprentice television show has travelled to the reclusive state four times since 2013 as part of a quixotic mission to broker a detente deal between the US and North Korea.The State Department denied that there was a connection between the Warmbier's release and the former NBA start's controversial visit. It also said that the Trump administration did not authorize Rodman's visit and warned Americans against going to North Korea.When quizzed by reporters in Beijing while en route to the North, Rodman said that issue of Americans detained by Pyongyang was "not my purpose right now." However, he added that Trump would be happy with the trip as he was "trying to accomplish something we both need," prompting speculation he could potentially be pserving as the administration as an unofficial envoy.dm/rt (AP, AFP, Reuters)
