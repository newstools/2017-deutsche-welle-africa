An Israeli aircraft carried out strikes in Syria after 10 projectiles landed in the occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, the Israeli military said.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a video on Twitter showing airstrikes on a Syrian army heavy machine gun position and two tanks.Israel said the errant fire caused no damage or casualties but constituted an "unacceptable breach" of sovereignty."We have no intention of allowing the breech of our sovereignty and harming of our security to go unpassed," said Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. "As far as we are concerned, the Assad regime is responsible for what is happening in its territory and it will continue to bear the consequences if such events repeat themselves."The incident occurred as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad battle rebels including hardline Islamist factions tied to al-Qaeda and the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) in Quneitra province, bordering on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.Syria's state-run media SANA reported that the army repelled an attack from al-Qaeda linked rebels near Baath city when the "Israeli enemy" attacked, causing damage to buildings and unknown casualties. It accused Israel of supporting terrorist organizations.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, said two Syrian soldiers were killed in the attack. It also reported fighting in Quneitra between the Syrian army and rebels.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week denied Israel provides support to Syrian rebels after the Wall Street Journal reported a special Israeli unit was providing aid to rebels.The US paper, citing multiple rebel commanders and Israelis familiar with the strategy, said Israel has for years provided rebels with cash, food, fuel and medical treatment in order to create a friendly force along a buffer zone to separate it from Iranian and Hezbollah forces backing the Assad regime.The cash has reportedly been used by rebel groups like Fursan al-Joulan to pay salaries and procure weapons and ammunition.Israel has long boasted of providing medical treatment to Syrians as a humanitarian gesture, but the paper suggested this was a means for Israel to create loyal Syrian rebels. Israeli officials have also said rebels receive treatment as part of a deal that they don't attack Druse, an ethnic and religious minority on both sides of the Golan.Israel has carried out a number airstrikes in Syria since the civil war erupted in 2011.Most of the airstrikes have targeted weapons shipments or supplies of Israel's Lebanese enemy Hezbollah, which along with Iran and Russia is one of the key backers helping the al-Assad regime fight rebels and Islamist militants in Syria.cw/jm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)
