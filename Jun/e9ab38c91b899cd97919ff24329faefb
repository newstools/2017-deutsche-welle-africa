The release said the experience was greatly enjoyed by the girls, who were required to wear hard hats and enclosed shoes at all times.Local TV channel Jihoceske filmed a feature on the shoot, showing the models touring the Czech Republic's largest power station which is about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north east of the state of Bavaria on the German border.The competition caused an outcry among Czech news and social media."The competition is absolutely outside the bounds of ethics.
