It's very important for me to be in the quarterfinals one more time," said Nadal, who turned 31 on Saturday. "Probably I didn't play as well as I did the other day, but I still played well."He'll face 20th-seeded Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight after the Spaniard knocked off fifth-seeded Milos Raonic 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-7 (6), 6-4, 8-6.Austrian sixth seed Dominic Thiem also progressed with an impressive straight sets victory over Horacio Zeballos of Argentina. He'll play defending champion Novak Djokovic in the last eight after the Serbian defending champion eased past claycourt specialist Alberto Ramos-Vinolas 7-6(5) 6-1 6-3.Muguruza, Williams exits pave the way for new championGarbine Muguruza wasn't able to defend her titleDespite 16 double faults, Kristina Mladenovic ended defending champion Garbine Muguruza's hopes of back-to-back titles with a 6-1 3-6 6-3, win that sent the home favorite in to the quarterfinals.After a nervy opening set, Spanish fourth seed Muguruza rallied but 13th-seeded Frenchwoman Mladenovic made her shots when it mattered to set up a meeting with Timea Bascinszky, who beat Venus Williams."Everything wasn't perfect. There were a few concerns," Mladenovic said, before joking: "I made about 35 double-faults today, but everything's [okay]!"Williams' chances of adding a first French Open title to her collection of seven grand slams faded after the 36-year-old was beaten 5-7 6-2 6-1 by Bascinszky.Williams, seeded 10th and competing in her 20th French Open, fought back from 5-1 down rattling off six straight games to win the first set.But she ran out of steam as the 27-year-old Bacsinszky, who had wasted two set points in the first set, chased her across the court and won the next two with ease, clinching the match with a perfect drop shot.
