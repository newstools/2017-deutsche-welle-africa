However, insiders claimed that the prime minister was beginning to assert his independence from PSD boss Liviu Dragnea, who is widely acknowledged to pull the strings behind party scenes.Grindeanu added fuel to those claims by refusing to resign, and instead accusing Dragnea of seeking to concentrate all the power in his own hands.Observers maintain that Mihai Tudose (right), as economy minister under Sorin Grindeanu (left), was in large part to blame for the government's failed reform package.Many observers also remarked that the PSD was likely looking to install someone in power willing to make more of an effort to protect officials facing corruption charges, such as Dragnea, who is on trial for alleged abuse of power and voter fraud.A proposed bill decriminalizing several corruption offences was put forward in the first months of Grindeanu premiership. However, it sparked the largest mass protests seen since the fall of Romania's Communist regime in 1989 and was subsequently withdrawn.Romanian media on Monday also underlined the fact that Tudose was one of the ministers held responsible for the Grindeanu's government failure to implement reforms, suggesting that he continues to enjoy close relations with the PSD hierarchy.dm/xx (Reuters, AFP)
