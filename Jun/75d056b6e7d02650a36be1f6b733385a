German painter Max Beckmann's "Bird's Hell" sold at Christie's impressionist and modern art sale for 36 million pounds (40.8 million euros, $45.8 million) on Tuesday, setting a new auction record for German Expressionism.The work, painted between 1937 and 1938, is perceived as one of the most important anti-Nazi statements Beckmann ever made. "Bird's Hell" depicts huge bird-like creatures swooping on naked people.The painting has been "unanimously recognized as the Guernica of Expressionism," said Christie's international director of impressionist and modern art, Adrien Meyer.Beckmann (1884-1950) was highly acclaimed in his native Germany, until the Nazis declared his works "degenerate," removing his works from museums in 1937.The painter left his home country to live in self-exile in Amsterdam for a decade, and later moved to the United States. He died in New York at the age of 66. "Bird's Hell" broke the previous world auction record for a German expressionist painting, which had been set by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's painting "Berlin Street Scene" (1913-1914), auctioned at Christie's in New York in 2006 for $38 million.Click through the gallery below to discover the world's most expensive artworks sold at auction.From 1954-55, Pablo Picasso did a series of 15 paintings inspired by Delacroix's "Les Femmes d'Alger," with versions named "A" through "O." He started them after the death of Henry Matisse, as a tribute to his friend and artistic rival. "Version O" broke the world record for an auction sale, selling for $179.4 million (167.1 million euros) at Christie's in May 2015.At a Christie's auction held in November 2015, seven potential buyers spent nine frantic minutes bidding on this painting. It was finally snapped by a telephone bidder from China. The nude, painted in 1917-18, provoked a scandal at its first exhibition in Paris. The police shut down the art show after a crowd gathered outside the window.This 1907 painting by Gustav Klimt is considered one of the most elaborate and representative of his "golden phase." In 2006, it was sold through a private sale brokered by Christie's for a record sum for a painting, $135 million. That same year, Jackson Pollock's classic drip painting "No. 5 1948" broke that record, obtaining $140 million through another private sale.Van Gogh allegedly said of the homeopathic doctor Dr. Gachet, whom he painted here in 1890, that "he was sicker than I am." The plant is a foxglove, which is used to make the drug digitalis. In 1990, the work was auctioned off to Ryoei Saito, Japan's second-largest paper manufacturer, for $82.5 million, making it the world's priciest painting at the time (the price above has been adjusted). This 1969 triptych documents Francis Bacon's friendship and rivalry with fellow painter Lucian Freud. At the time it was sold, in November 2013, it obtained the highest price for a work of art at an auction, until Picasso - and now Modigliani - surpassed that record in 2015.This 1876 work by Impressionist master Renoir depicts a dance venue for high society on the outskirts of Paris, the Moulin de la Galette. One of Renoir's most famous works, it exudes the joie de vivre that is characteristic of his style. In 1990, the work was purchased for $78.1 million (adjusted price above) by Japanese buyer Ryoei Saito, along with van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet."This portrait of an adolescent holding a pipe and wearing a garland of flowers in his hair was created during the Spanish master's "Rose Period" in 1905. Just a little under a century later, the painting fetched an impressive sum of $104.2 million at a Sotheby's auction in 2004 (price adjusted above).This agonizing character painted by Edvard Munch is one of the most iconic paintings in the world. The Expressionist artist had actually made four versions of it: Three are in Norwegian museums, and the fourth one was sold for the screeching price of $119.9 million in May 2012 at Sotheby's, which would be adjusted to $130.7 million today.Inspired by his mistress Marie-Th r se Walther, Picasso created this painting in a single day in 1932. If you add the eight minutes and six seconds it took for the auction record bid at Christie's in May 2010, it still appears to be well-invested time. Its price could be adjusted to $115.7 million today.In 1889, after suffering from mental health issues, Vincent van Gogh voluntarily entered an asylum, where he went on to create some 130 artworks. One of them was "Irises," modeled on the flowers in the asylum's garden and perhaps influenced by the style of Japanese woodblock prints. It sold at Sotheby's in 1987 for $53.9 million, which would be $112.5 million today. Author: Elizabeth Grenier, Kate M ser eg/sb (AFP, dpa)
