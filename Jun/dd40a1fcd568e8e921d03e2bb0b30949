Airbus on Friday predicted a steep rise in demand for passenger planes globally, saying that more than twice as many aircraft would be required to meet demand over the next 20 years.Raising its forecast for the next two decades, the European plane maker insisted a slowdown in orders over the past several months did not signal an overall drop in the market."The trend is positive," Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. The company warned last week it expected slow orders this year and perhaps next year, but added it was a normal part of the business cycle.Job creationAirbus said some 35,000 new planes worth $5.3 trillion (4.7 trillion euros) would be needed over the next 20 years.
