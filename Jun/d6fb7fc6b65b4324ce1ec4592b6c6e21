"This approach of 13 demands is against international law because you cannot attack or intervene in the sovereignty of a country."US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on the quarreling Arab states to begin a dialogue aimed at trying to work out their differences."A productive next step would be for each of the countries to sit together and continue this conversation," Tillerson said in a statement. "We believe our allies and partners are stronger when they are working together towards one goal which we all agree is stopping terrorism and countering extremism."He said the US supports Kuwait's mediation efforts, and added, "A lowering of rhetoric would also help ease the tension."Turkey, the most powerful country in the region still supporting Qatar, has sent 100 cargo planes carrying supplies since Qatar's despite the neighbors announced a blockade of sea and air routes in the country.Two contingents of Turkish troops, accompanied by columns of armored vehicles have arrived at the military base within the past three weeks, and Turkish Defence Minister Fikri Isik said on Friday that further reinforcements would be beneficial."The strengthening of the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security," he said.
