Project goal: Installation of a modern wastewater system in Cusco, Peru Project size: The modernization saves 5,300 tons of CO2 annually for the pilot firm SEDACUSCO Financing: International Climate Initiative (IKI) is funding this and similar initiatives in Jordan, Mexico and Thailand with 6.5 million euros ($7.3 million) Implementation: German development agency GIZAround 80 percent of sewage worldwide is channeled into the environment without being treated. Unprocessed wastewater creates three times more greenhouse emissions than that which is treated. Cusco's sewage modernization project has improved sewage sludge treatment, and the facility now creates biogas. The location couldn't be more historic - Cusco was at the heart of the Incan empire, and the nearby world-famous Inca citadel Machu Picchu attracts millions of tourists annually.
