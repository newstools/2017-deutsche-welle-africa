Franke had to wait six months before she could go to school."This is still a problem," she told DW. "The biggest challenge for migrant children arriving in Germany is access to education. It's really difficult to immediately go to school. In the meantime you're just bored and missing your education," Franke said, adding that the curriculum content also needs to be improved."We also need better content for children with a migration background so they have a better understanding of the new culture they live in and so they can also learn the language quicker," she said, but stressed that refugee children shouldn't be separated."All the the students have to connect so we can achieve integration," Franke said.

While her family remained in Massachusetts, Quintao was sent back to Brazil - a country she could barely remember.Having recently graduated with a degree in international relations in Brazil, Quintao said it was a "great feeling" to have overcome the situation."But detention is no place for children," she added.
