During last year's election campaign, Trump the candidate sometimes referred to it as a "hoax" created by China. After launching his bid for the White House in 2015, Trump said "I'm not a believer in man-made global warming." But since entering office, Trump and his staff have mostly kept quiet on the issue.Trump himself ignored a question about climate change when asked by journalists on Friday.
