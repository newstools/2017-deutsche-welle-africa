US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has urged China to help pressure North Korea to rein in its weapons programs."[China has a] diplomatic responsibility to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime if they want to prevent further escalation in the region," he said in Washington. Tillerson said North Korea was the "top security threat" to the US.Tillerson made the comments at a press conference after high-level talks with Chinese officials at the State Department.Read more: Trump 'furious' over Seoul's North Korea 'appeasement'Read more: North Korea attempts to split South Korea-US security allianceDefense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed at the same press conference to "continue to take necessary measures to defend ourselves and our allies" against North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US.The meeting of top US and Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs came just a day after US President Donald Trump said China's efforts to use its leverage with Pyongyang had failed.On Tuesday, Trump posted a tweet suggesting Chinese President Xi Jinping's efforts were ineffective, a message he reiterated before supporters in Iowa."I do like President Xi," he told the crowd Wednesday evening. "I wish we would have a little more help with respect to North Korea, from China. That doesn't seem to be working."Trump did not elaborate on what might happen next if China fails to rein in its ally.Complicated positionTrump's approach to North Korea was further complicated by the death of American university student Otto Warmbier earlier this week, after he was recently released in a comatose state 17 months after being jailed in Pyongyang.Read more: Otto Warmbier, US student released from North Korea, diesIn Beijing, officials insisted they have not given up hope of influencing Pyongyang."To resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, China has been making unremitting efforts and we have been playing an important and constructive role," said Geng Shuang, a foreign ministry spokesman, while stressing China was not the "focus and the crux" of the crisis.Tillerson said Trump would make a state visit to China later this year, and Mattis said both sides had agreed to expand military-to-military ties.A US official said on Tuesday that spy satellites had detected new movements at North Korea's nuclear test site, but it was unclear if Pyongyang was preparing for a sixth nuclear test.North Korea hits back, labels Trump a 'psychopath'The North Korean regime on Thursday sought to stoke tensions and take advantage of the US' difficult position by calling Trump a "psychopath" and warning South Korea against following Washington's lead. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said that "South Korea must realize that following psychopath Trump...will only lead to disaster."The newspaper also claimed that the US president was toying with the idea of a preemptive strike on the North as a means of diverting attention from the political crisis he faces at home.North Korea has carried out a number of atomic and ballistic missile tests since last year, ratcheting up tensions with its regional neighbors and the US.With 700,000 active troops and another 4.5 million in the reserves, North Korea can call upon almost a quarter of its population to serve in the army at any given time. Every male in the country is required to undertake some form of military training and can be called to serve at any time. The North's bloated army is believed to outnumber its southern neighbor's by two-to-one.The 2016 Global Firepower Index revealed the North had, as part of a far-reaching arsenal, 70 submarines, 4,200 tanks, 458 fighter jets, 572 fixed-wing attack aircraft among others. The picture above from 2013 shows leader Kim Jong Un ordering strategic rocket forces to be on standby to strike US and South Korean targets at any time.Every year, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and citizens role through the streets of the capital Pyongyang to take part in the North's military parades. Preparations for the rallies often begin months in advance and are usually held on an important anniversary of the party or Kim Jong Un's family.Despite pressure from the international community, Pyongyang has made no secret of its nuclear ambitions. Alongside its ritual ballistic missile tests, North Korea has conducted nuclear tests on five occasions, two of which in 2016. The country claimed that the last warhead it tested could be attached to a rocket. Alongside the United States, Pyongyang views its neighbors South Korea and Japan as its two other main enemies. North Korea's has used US' military exercises in the regions as means of galvanizing its people, claiming that the exercises are dress rehearsals for impending invasion.In April, the US sent its Carl Vinson aircraft carrier towards the Korean Peninsula, saying it was taking prudent measures against the North. Pyongyang has vowed to "react to any mode of war." Intelligence officials estimate that North Korea could be less than two years away from striking the US. It seems increasingly les likely that US President Trump will allow that happen.aw/cmk (AFP, dpa)
