LeBron James set an NBA Finals record with his ninth triple-double, and the Cleveland Cavaliers had the highest-scoring first half ever in the Finals while beating the Golden State Warriors convincingly to stave off elimination on Friday night.The Cavaliers had 86 points at halftime and led by 24 during a physical and at times poorly officiated game while handing the Warriors their first loss of the postseason.James finished with 21 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to move past Magic Johnson, while Kyrie Irving led the Cavaliers with 40 points. Cleveland made 24 3-pointers."We have championship DNA," said James, who broke Magic Johnson's record with his ninth triple-double in the Finals. "We showed that tonight. We just kept our composure. We shared the ball, we moved the ball and defensively we were physical. It's one game."But it's one they had to have, and a series that wasn't living up to its hype and seemed headed for a quick conclusion is California bound for Game 5 on Monday night. "Our mindset is to go out there and get one," James said.Kevin Durant scored 35 points but the Warriors could never slow down the Cavs and missed their chance for the NBA's first perfect postseason.
