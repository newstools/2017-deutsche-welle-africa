Amid so much global political chaos, the role of the artist has never been more important, said Art Basel director Marc Spiegler during a press conference before the opening of the 48th edition of the Swiss art fair."Artists see the world through a different lens, they can more directly capture themes that many others cannot," said Spiegler on Tuesday in Basel.Some of the political work featured at this year's fair include "Orizzonte" (horizon), by Italian artists Francesco Arena, which features a metal bar covered in earth from a refugee camp on Lampedusa island. Set at eye-level, the work forces the viewer to reflect on the reality of the new "horizon" reached by many thousands of refugees every year.Meanwhile, the Parcours section of the show returns with 22 site-specific artworks set around Basel's historical M nsterplatz square. Parcours will feature artworks by both internationally renowned and emerging artists including Ai Weiwei, Katinka Bock, Miriam Cahn, Nathalie Djurberg and Rirkrit Tiravanija.Ai Weiwei's work will be on show at Art Basel 2017 Read more: One year with Ai Weiwei: DW premieres documentaryEngaging with Basel's past and present by weaving artistic interventions into the fabric of the city, this year's edition of Parcours portrays a series of intimate experiences.
