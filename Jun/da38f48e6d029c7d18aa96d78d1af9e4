The Syrian army said Saturday in a statement that a ceasefire had been implemented in Deraa, an area covered by an accord brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran last month to set up "safe zones" in the war-ravaged country."This comes to support efforts for national reconciliation," the army said.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the ceasefire was largely holding in the city, adding the truce was a result of a deal brokered by Jordan, Russia and the United States.A fierce battle between President Bashar al-Assad's troops and Islamist rebels has been raging in Deraa since early June.A Syrian opposition source told the German DPA news agency that Assad's regime opted for a ceasefire as it was losing the battle."The military situation on the ground in Deraa is in favor of the revolutionaries. Reaching a truce is considered a victory for the revolutionary factions," the source told DPA on condition of anonymity.

"The opposition should similarly halt attacks to allow the ceasefire to endure - and hopefully be extended - and humanitarian aid to reach those in need."The local ceasefire comes on the same day as the United Nations announced a fresh round of peace talks in Geneva on July 10.Russia said it would hold its own talks in Kazakhstan's capital Astana on July 4-5.Multiple rounds of Syria peace talks have not yielded much in the way of results.
