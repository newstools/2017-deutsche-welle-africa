"The first plane dropped the ordnance accurately, but the second one missed and hit our troops," Lorenzana said. "We are still investigating if there was a miscommunication, whether there was an error on the ground or in the air on the part of the pilot."Following the incident, the Philippine military has deployed more ground troops and armored vehicles, indicating it could pull back on airstrikes. Lorenzana said he would leave that decision to the ground commanders, but added that he was confident the estimated 50 to 100 Maute fighters still holed up in the city "cannot hold that long."Scores killed, tens of thousands displaced in Marawi CityFighting in Marawi City broke out on May 23 after hundreds Islamist militants seized buildings, stole weapons and released prisoners to join their fight in the city.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte answered by declaring martial law in the region and launching a major offensive on the city, saying he was concerned that the southern Mindanao area could become a hotbed for Islamist extremism.
