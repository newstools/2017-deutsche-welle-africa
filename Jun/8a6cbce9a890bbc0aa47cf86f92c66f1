The British government on Sunday vowed to act on any recommendations from an inquest into the a fire that consumed a 24-story high-rise tower in the west of London and killed at least 58 people.Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers were scrambling to make up ground following stinging criticism that the government's initial response to the disaster. In an interview on Saturday, May admitted that the government's response to the disaster was "not good enough" as she announced a fast-tracked public inquiry into the fire promised to provide increased aid to help survivors cope and find alternative housing.Read more: London fire : 58 confirmed or presumed dead after Grenfell Tower disasterThe move comes as anger on the streets continues to rise following days of protests. Anger was directed in part towards May, who failed to meet with survivors when she visited the charred remains of the block of Wednesday, and at the local government for failing to guarantee the safety of the building.On Sunday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said believed the flammable materials used to clad the building were illegal in Britain.Trade Minister Greg Hands added that the government is conducting what he called an "urgent inspection" of some 2,500 other tower blocks across Britain to evaluate their safety.'A preventable accident'London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the disaster a "preventable accident that didn't need to happen. He went on to say, "The tragedy we're seeing is because of the consequences of mistakes and neglect from the politicians, the council and the government.""There is a feeling from the community that they've been treated badly because some of them are poor," Khan added.He also pointed out that dozens of tower blocks across London built in the 1960s and 1970s, like Grenfell Tower, may have failed to comply with current standards. Speaking after a church service near the charred remains of the building, Khan said, "It may well be the defining outcome of this tragedy that the worst mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s are systematically torn down."

Some fire officials said they had never seen a building fire move so quickly.Reports suggest that a renovation project on Grenfell Tower last year intentionally did not include safety devices such as sprinklers and doors designed to keep the fire from spreading.The company behind the renovation also reportedly used banned, flammable cladding on the building's exterior to cut costs and make it more aesthetically attractive for neighbors in the Kensington and Chelsea borough, one of the UK's richest areas.Stinging criticism from the oppositionThe UK's opposition Labour party launched a stinging attack of the Conservative government in the wake of the fire, underscoring the role austere economic policies may have had in the disaster.Read more: Grief turns to anger as protesters march over London tower fire responseOn Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, recently emboldened by a better-than-expected result in this month's snap election, called on the government drop its cuts in funding to local authorities."In the wake of (the) Grenfell fire, we have to recognize that something has gone badly, badly wrong in this country, that predominantly poor people die in a towering inferno because possibly in the long term (there had been a) lack of public investment," Corbyn told broadcaster ITV.Amid reports that the government is struggling to find housing for the hundreds of Grenfell Tower survivors left homeless by the blaze, Corbyn called on May to repossess empty homes and offer them to the displaced residents. "Occupy it, compulsory purchase it, requisition it - there's a lot of things you can do," he said.Government promises to actThe prime minister announced a fast-tracked public inquiry into what caused the fire to rapidly spread through the high-rise block of apartments and promised to provide increased aid to help survivors cope and find alternative housing."I have ordered that more staff be deployed across the area, wearing high visibility clothing, so they can easily be found, dispense advice and ensure the right support is provided," May said on Saturday following a meeting with survivors at her Downing Street residence.

Among the criticisms launched at May was also her government's failure to provide up to the minute information to survivors.As part of the inquiry, prominent Labour politician David Lammy said the government and police must seize all documents and records related to the building's renovation to avoid the destruction of incriminating evidence."The prime minister needs to act immediately to ensure that all evidence is protected so that everyone culpable for what happened at Grenfell Tower is held to account and feels the full force of the law," Lammy said. "When the truth comes out about this tragedy, we may find that there is blood on the hands of a number of organizations."
