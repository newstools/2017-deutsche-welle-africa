Norbert Lammert, who chairs the Bundestag, said former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's "polarizing" character served as the "personified confidence-building measure" people were looking for in 1989 as calls for reunification rang out in then East Germany and West Germany.Read more: Opinion: A Funeral fit for Pharaoh KohlKohl's close talks with French, US and Russian heads of state during communist East Germany's collapse and German reunification in 1990 resulted from his belief that politics must be shaped by understanding history, Lammert said.Kohl was a stroke of luck for Germany and Europe, Lammert saidKohl's 'farsighted" approach was that "politics without history is ineffective," Lammert added.The outcome - for which Kohl laid the foundation - was a reunited Germany in a peaceful Europe, Lammert said, adding that before 1989, Kohl with his "assured instinct" never gave up hope, despite many doubters in Germany.German presidents, present and pastListening to Thursday's eulogy in Berlin's restored Reichstag building - just meters from the former Berlin Wall - were the present and two former German heads of state, current President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and former presidents Joachim Gauck and Horst Kohler.Lammert added the former chancellor's death also marked a "deep cut" for Germany's present-day population from its past generations of leaders, such as Konrad Adenauer, Willy Brandt and Kohl.For them Germany's "moral breakdown" during the Nazi era that culminated in the Second World War was retold through personal experience, not a second-hand account, Lammert said.Kohl and his second wife Maike Kohl-Richter in 2014Kohl, who stood reconciled with French President Francois Mitterrand in Verdun in 1984 and who, in Dresden in 1989, recalled the loss of his older brother in the war had sworn that war would never again emanate from Germany, Lammert said.Poland trip resumed, not canceledThe importance Kohl placed on central and eastern Europe was exemplified, said Lammert, by his learning about the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, while visiting Poland.He returned to then-West Germany but two days later, on November 11, he resumed his trip to Poland.Lammert also recounted Kohl's rhetorical abrasiveness, including hefty verbal exchanges with the late Social Democratic Party former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, whom Kohl beat in 1982, and Kohl's emergence as a young parliamentarian in his Rhineland-Palatinate home state in the 1960s. While many of the then-student generation wanted "revolution," Kohl had set his goals on the modernization of post-war Germany, Lammert said.And, Kohl had a "phenomenal" memory, both politically and privately, Lammert added, recalling in an indirect reference to incumbent conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel that Kohl was often on the lookout for young political talent.Merkel, from eastern Germany, began her post-1989 political career as a protrge of Kohl but later broke with him when he became mired in a party slush fund scandal.Resting place in Speyer plannedReportedly at Kohl's request, no state funeral will be held in Germany. Instead, the European Parliament will hold a memorial ceremony for him in Strasbourg on July 1.That's to be followed by a funeral in the Catholic cathedral in Speyer, a city on the Rhine River and the burial site of historic European personalities, near Kohl's home of Ludwigshafen.
