The Plastic Bottle Village is an eco-residential community nestled in the heart of the jungle in the Panamanian province of Bocas del Toro. The brainchild of activist Robert Bezeau, the village's aim is to show how plastic waste can be transformed into low-cost sustainable housing.Bezeau hopes to build a small settlement of around 120 homes, all made from recycled plastic bottles. The idea, he says, is to change "the world, without changing the Earth, one home at a time."Click through the gallery to see how the Plastic Bottle Village is taking shape.
