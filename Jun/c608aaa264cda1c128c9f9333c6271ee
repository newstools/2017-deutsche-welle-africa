Schalke parted company with head coach Markus Weinzierl on Friday after just a year at the helm.Schalke sporting director Christian Heidel said the decision came after club officials examined the best way to "lay foundations for a successful future.""The result of our deliberations is that we must make changes to drive the development we want. This also includes a new appointment of the head coach," said Heidel. "This decision was not easy for me. My thanks go to Markus Weinzierl, whom I wish all the best for the future."Read: Bayer Leverkusen appoint Heiko Herrlich as head coachThe Royal Blues recruited Weinzierl from Augsburg shortly after Christian Heidel was named the club's sporting director last May.

It was their worst showing in Germany's top division in six years.The club announced Domenico Tedesco will take his place next season. The 31-year-old coach has been in charge of second division club Erzgebirge Aue since March 8, saving the club from relegation to the third tier.The appointment appears to have been influenced by the success enjoyed by Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim had last season with another young coach, Julian Nagelsmann.
