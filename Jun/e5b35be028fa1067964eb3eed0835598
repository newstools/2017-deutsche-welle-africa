Cameroon 1-1 Australia (Zambo Anguissa 45+1' - Milligan pen. 61') Krestovsky Stadium, St. PetersburgFormer Leverkusen winger Robbie Kruse, still without a team, fired wide early on, but most of the opening half an hour passed with light sparring from both sides.A lovely one-two from Cameroon shortly before the 40-minute mark saw Benjamin Moukandjo strike a goal, and while Mathew Ryan saved easily it was a sign of things to come. Christian Bassogog's speed opened Australia up on the break, and while that attack ended in nothing, the African nation soon had the opening their play deserved.A great ball down the right wing from Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui was met by midfielder Zambo Anguissa who instinctively flicked the ball over the out-rushing Ryan for the lead.Australia made no mistake from the spot to salvage a pointAfter the restart, Australia looked the better side and had chances to score, but they were only really spurred into action when they almost conceded a second. Two minutes after Zambo Anguissa fired wide of the far post, the Socceroos were level. A foul from Ernest Mabouka resulted in a penalty (VAR approved) and Mark Milligan left the keeper no chance.The tempo of the game picked up as both sides went for the win. Vincent Aboubakar headed just over the bar and although Cameroon looked the more likely to reclaim the lead, and perhaps should have done, both sides had to make do with a share of the spoils.
