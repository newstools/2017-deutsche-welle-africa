Steinmeier told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper Wednesday that in addition to centuries-long anti-Semitism in Germany, anti-Jewish sentiment existed among some newly arrived Muslim migrants - and all of it was being stoked by hate tirades on social media.The majority of German society and the civil administration, however, has positioned itself clearly against anti-Semitism and condemned it, said Steinmeier, adding "and that is very important.""Unfortunately in Germany - similar to other European countries - heightened anti-Semitic resentment can again be observed, Steinmeier said, citing a recent report submitted to cabinet and parliament."The social media often propagate the spread of hate messages and anti-Semitic provocation," he said.Steinmeier visited Israel's President Rueven Rivlin in MayAugsburg celebrating synagogueAttacks on persons because of their beliefs amounted to attacks on society as a whole, insisted Germany's ceremonial head of state.The former foreign minister, who visited Israel in May, made his remarks ahead of his planned speech. His presence in Augsburg was part of the city's celebrations to mark its synagogue's 100th anniversary.The Chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany Josef Schuster, Bavaria's Premier Horst Seehofer and Israeli Ambassador Yacov-David Hadas Handelsmann were also among the dignitaries invited to attend the event.Augsburg's synagogue was the only Jewish house of worship across Bavarian cities to survive the Nazi onslaught under Hitler in the 1930s largely undamaged."It seems a miracle that today it [the synagogue] - 80 years after the breakdown of civilization during the Holocaust - has become a vibrant Jewish community," Steinmeier told the newspaper.Augsburg's synagogue was spared complete destruction during Hitler's time in powerContrast with FranceThe Augsburger Allgemeine's interviewer recalled that thousands of anxious Jews had recently left France for Israel and asked Steinmeier what Germany was doing to make Jewish life self-sustaining."There is no noticeable migratory outflow of people of Jewish belief among us here," replied Steinmeier, adding Germany must, however, remain alert and foster understanding among various societal and religious groups."For the good fortune of all, Germany can again be the home of which the Jews were robbed by [Hitler's] National Socialists," he said.Steinmeier recalled that Walter Jacob, a "famous son" and pre-war rabbi of Augsburg, wrote in his memoirs that the Jewish community once felt "fully at home."

The young man shouted back: Shut up you Jew!" Bernheim recalled, adding that the cyclist vanished too fast for him to reply to the verbal abuse.Schuster wants anti-Semitism commissioner in BerlinCall for special commissionerLast week, a 300-page report on anti-Semitism was discussed in Germany's Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, prompting Schuster to renew the Central Council of Jew's call that an anti-Semitism commissioner be assigned to the Berlin Federal Chancellery headed by Angela Merkel, and that a nation-wide database on anti-Semitic crimes be established.The report had concluded that anti-Semitism was present at all levels of German society, stoked by hate commentaries on social media. Some analyst put its pervasion at one-in-four.Federal Interior Ministry State Secretary G nter Krings, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrat conservatives, said the current government would not decide on whether to appoint such a commissioner.Due to its history, Germany had a special responsibility towards Jewish communities, Krings added.ipj/rg (epd, KNA, dpa, AFP)
