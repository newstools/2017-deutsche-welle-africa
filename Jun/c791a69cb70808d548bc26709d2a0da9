A Holocaust survivor and the first president of the European Parliament, Simone Veil, has died at the age of 89. Her son made the announcement on Friday, prompting tributes from around the world."Simone Veil was a symbol, legend and proof that nothing can beat the human spirit," wrote EU Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic on Twitter.Veil was "the best of France," said French President Emmanuel Macron.Born Simone Jacob in Nice in 1927, Veil was 17 years old when she was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Her father, mother and brother perished in the Nazi death camps, but Veil survived along with two sisters. She met husband Antoine Veil while studying law. The couple had three sons.She quickly rose to prominence both as a judge who fought for improved prison conditions in France, and for her crusade against back-alley abortions. Indeed her campaign to legalize abortion in France is one of her most famous accomplishments as a lawmaker.A stalwart centrist, Veil was almost universally respected by her fellow politicians despite fierce opposition to her positions, including on abortion.Veil was also an ardent supporter of European integration, becoming head of the European Parliament in 1979, serving a three-year term.Domestically, she spoke openly against the far-right National Front (FN), and about her pacifism and experiences during World War II."The idea of war was for me something terrible," the French Academy member told the Associated Press in 2007. "The only possible option was to make peace."es/msh (AP, AFP)
