China on Thursday posted a forecast-busting increase in its trade activities in May, with official data signaling improvement in the national economy.Exports rose by 8.7 percent to $191 billion (169.6 billion euros) in the month under review. Imports jumped by 14.8 percent, but totaling only $150.2 billion and leaving China with a larger trade surplus of $40.8 billion.The readings were good news for many economists, who had seen a string of weak data in previous months, while others voiced concern about US President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric. He had frequently said that China's and above all Germany's large trade surpluses were "bad" for the US.New challenges aheadChina's economy has recently had to deal with weaker demand and excess industrial capacity left over from a debt-fueled infrastructure boom.
