The 'ndrangheta is Italy's most powerful mafia organization, having overtaken Sicily's Cosa Nostra and is considered one of the leading traffickers of cocaine into Europe.Italian media reported Macri intended to fly to Caracas, Venezuela, where he was believed to be living under a false identity.Italian authorities have been trying to arrest Macri since 2015, when they accused him of international drug trafficking and mafia membership. He is expected to be extradited from Brazil to Italy.
