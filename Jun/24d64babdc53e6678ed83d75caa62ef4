Operators of publicly accessible wireless networks in Germany will no longer be liable for the illegal activities of their users, thanks to new legislation passed in the Bundestag on Friday.Before the new legislation passed, operators of wireless internet hotspots faced fines and legal action if people used the network to download copyright content. That liability greatly hindered the rollout of wifi networks as businesses feared liability.As a result Germany severely lags behind other countries when it comes to providing free internet, with just two wireless hotspots for every 10,000 people. The problem frustrated locals as well as the rising number of foreign visitors who are left scratching their heads at the difficulty of finding an internet connection outside of their hotel.Providers will no longer have to password-protect their networks or require users to register when the legislation comes into effect later this year, Minister of Economic Affairs Brigitte Zypries said.The ruling grand coalition agreed to the changes after lengthy negotiations aimed at enforcing the rights of copyright holders while still relaxing the laws.Copyright-holders retain some powerRights holders can still demand wireless network operators block individual and specifically named pages to prevent repeat copyright infringements, Zypries said. Such blocks are generally possible "simply and without prior technical knowledge", the Minister said.Read: Berlin public and corporate Wi-Fi block LGBT-friendly websitesRead: Germany to invest 100 billion into national gigabit internet networkIndustry association Bitkom and the Green party said that clause would hamper the rollout of hotspots, saying operators could face financial risk from legal action.Whether hate speech, propaganda or activism, governments across the globe have upped efforts to curb content deemed illegal from circulating on social networks. From drawn out court cases to blanket bans, DW examines how some countries try to stop the circulation of illicit content while others attempt to regulate social media.In Germany, Justice Minister Heiko Maas has proposed a law that would impose heavy fines on social media companies, such as Facebook, for failing to take down posts containing hate speech. But Facebook has pushed back, saying "preventing and combating hate speech and fake news is a public task that the state cannot avoid." The law is currently being reviewed by a German parliamentary committee.In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that European citizens had the right to request search engines, such Google and Bing, remove "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive" search results linked to their name. Although Google has complied with the ruling, it has done so reluctantly, warning that it could make the internet as "free as the world's least free place."In May, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Russian social media platforms and web services. The blanket ban affected millions of Ukrainian citizens, many of whom were anxious about their data. The move prompted young Ukrainians to protest on the streets, calling for the government to reinstate access to platforms that included VKontakte (VK), Russia's largest social network.In 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled that Safe Harbor, a 15-year-old pact between the US and EU that allowed the transfer of personal data without prior approval, was effectively invalid. Austrian law student Max Schrems had launched the legal proceedings against Facebook in response to revelations made by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, Edward Snowden.In China, the use of social media is highly regulated by the government. Beijing has effectively blocked access to thousands of websites and platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. Instead, China offers its citizens access to local social media platforms, such as Weibo and WeChat, which boast hundreds of millions of monthly users.
