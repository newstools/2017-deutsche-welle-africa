Two Filipino legislators filed a supplemental complaint against President Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court (ICC) this week urging the court to conduct a preliminary examination into Duterte's brutal crackdown on drugs that has left thousands dead.Senator Antonio Trillanes and Congressman Gary Alejano submitted the complaint to the ICC supporting the charges filed in April by Jude Sabio, a lawyer representing self-confessed assassin Edgar Matobato of the alleged vigilante group Davao Death Squad. In his complaint, Sabio alleged that Duterte has been "repeatedly, unchangingly, and continuously" propagating murder in the Southeast Asian country and accused the president of mass murder and extrajudicial killings, constituting crimes against humanity.Trillanes: 'The fact that the killings continued after the filing of the first complaint heightens the need for the ICC to investigate right away'Read: Why is Duterte so popular in the Philippines?The complaint filed by Trillanes and Alejano detailed accounts of extrajudicial killings and also provided a list of killings which transpired after the first communication was filed by Sabio."These updates prove that the killings are widespread, systematic and perpetrated by police through the so-called legitimate police operations or through vigilante-style executions. These killings are state-sponsored and the Philippine government has no intention to stop this policy, and is unwilling and unable to investigate the people behind this," Trillanes told DW.Since Duterte assumed the presidency last year, he has been relentless in carrying out his bloody war on drugs.The latest figures provided by the Philippine National Police (PNP) in May estimate that more than 3,000 suspected drug users and dealers have been killed in what they have called legitimate police operations. There are close to 8,000 homicide cases related to the drug war under investigation."The fact that the killings continued after the filing of the first complaint heightens the need for the ICC to investigate right away," Trillanes said.

Among the countries not covered by the court are the United States, Russia, China and Israel."The filing of the supplemental complaint does not mean that the first complaint was not considered. On the contrary, it will further strengthen the information provided by Sabio," countered Trillanes.

Agencies of government, particularly the department of justice, cannot be relied on since its secretary has been vocal in defending and justifying the actions of the president," Alejano told DW.Political analyst Richard Heydarian said that the dismissal of the impeachment complaint "shows Duterte's grip on the legislative branch."With impeachment ruled out, the opposition was left with no other option but to pursue an alternative strategy through the ICC."The impeachment was railroaded with no serious attempt to consider the charges and the evidence. This will help an ICC case against President Duterte as it shows unwillingness to hold him accountable," international law expert Tony La Vi a told DW via email from Manila.Inmates who cannot be accommodated in the prison cells sleep on the ground in the open air.

His campaign against drugs has shown no mercy. He has called on the people to kill drug addicts, which has led to an unprecedented wave of vigilantism in the Southeast Asian nation. Cases have been filed against 600,000 drug dealers and addicts so far, completely overwhelming the justice system. Author: Rodion Ebbighausen / sri Martial law Additional tensions are arising from Duterte's May 23 declaration of martial law in the entire province of Mindanao after a terrorist group inspired by the so-called "Islamic State" took over Marawi City three weeks ago.Duterte claimed that his implementation of martial law would be "harsh" and would be no different from that during the time of ex-dictator Ferdinand Marcos.Read: Philippines - Black flags and smoke engulf MindanaoThe country's constitution dictates that congress and senate convene a joint session within 48 hours from the proclamation of martial law to deliberate on the measure. The two chambers of the legislature have the prerogative to call off a president's martial law declaration.To date, the two houses have not convened with certain lawmakers saying that it was not necessary."Prolonged martial law combined with protracted combat tends to wear down the military saddled with additional responsibilities and powers. If there is no effective guidance from the top levels of government, this may lead to griping and as fatigue sets in, griping can lead to politicization in the ranks," military and security expert Jose Antonio Custodio told DW.
