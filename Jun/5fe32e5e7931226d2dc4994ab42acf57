"It's a shock to everybody. For me, he was the most wonderful father you can imagine," she said. "But it's wonderful that he's left the legacy of his books and Paddington that will live on for ever, which is really very special."Paddington Bear has been enjoyed by generations of children, with more than 35 million books sold, the publisher said on Wednesday.
