This will be the largest police deployment in a German city in years, highlighting the gravity of the situatuion.Authorities barred several Die Rechte speakers from appearing on stage based on their previous attempts at inciting violence, and stopped organizers from using unconstitutional emblems or flags at the demo.On Saturday, the Karlsruhe city also hosts its annual gay pride festival under the slogan, "colorful love instead of brown (Nazi) hate."Far-right groups have held a number of demonstrations in Karlsruhe in the past. In February 2015, for example, a large right-wing group march took place under the label Kargida.Anti-refugee and anti-Islam groups such as PEGIDA have gained strength in Germany over the past few years following a massive influx of migrants from war-torn Middle Eastern and North African countries to Europe.
