The report also said the team intends to sign him to a new two-year contract.Nowitzki has played all 19 seasons of his career with the Mavericks. He won an NBA MVP award in 2007 and won an NBA title with Dallas in 2011.The top scorer of all time; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky hook was legendary. Abdul-Jabbar, who was born as Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor, and changed his name after he converted to Islam in 1971, played for just two teams, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers between 1969 and 1989. He played in the NBA all-star game 19 times. Karl "The Mailman" Malone played 18 seasons for the Utah Jazz before finishing his career with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004. He never won an NBA championship but he was a member of the US "Dream Team" that won Olympic gold in Barcelona in 1992. Bronze statues of Karl Malone and the guy who usually fed him the ball, John Stockton, stand outside of the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. The shooting guard spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, leading his team to five NBA titles. In 2006 Bryant scored 81 points in a game against the Toronto Raptors, the second highest single-game total after Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points in a 1962 game. At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant was the youngest player in NBA history to reach 30,000 career points.Michael "Air" Jordan was picked third overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 1984 NBA draft. He would have scored many more points had he not interrupted his career with two retirements; in 1993 and 1999. During his first retirement from basketball, during which his No. 23 was retired by the Chicago Bulls, Jordan played minor league baseball. He ended his career with the Washington Wizards in 2003.Wilt Chamberlain played 14 seasons in the NBA, turning out for the Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers. While playing for Philadelphia, the center set a single-game record of 100 points in a 1962 game against the New York Knicks. Prior to his NBA career "Wilt the Stilt" played a season with the Harlem Globetrotters. Who would have thought that a kid from Germany's second division would make it to the NBA, let alone become a superstar? This is exactly what Dirk Nowitzki did, after the then-DJK W rzburg power forward was selected ninth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1998 draft. They immediately traded him to the Dallas Mavericks, where he has spent his entire NBA career, becoming the league MVP in 2007.Listed at 2.16 meters tall (7 foot 1) and 147 kilograms (325 pounds), Shaquille O'Neal was one of the biggest men ever to play in the NBA. The center was drafted No. 1 overall by the Orlando Magic and went on to play for them and five other teams over a 19-year career. In 2000 Shaq became one of just three players to win the awards as NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP in the same year.The Cleveland Cavaliers made LeBron James the first overall pick of the 2004 draft and he led them to the franchise's first appearance in the NBA finals three years later, when they lost to the San Antonio Spurts. He left for the Miami Heat in 2010 and led them to the title in 2012 and 2013. In 2014 he returned to the Cavs and won over their skeptical fans by leading them to the NBA title in 2016.In 1974 Moses Malone became the first player to make it to the NBA out of high school. The center had his best years with the Philadelphia 76ers, where he won his only NBA title. Malone played for nine teams in a career that lasted 21 season. He was the NBA's MVP three times and was 12 times an NBA All-Star.The San Diego Rockets made Elvin Hayes the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA draft. The "Big E," who played 1,303 games between 1968 and 1984, won the NBA championship with the Washington Bullets in 1978. He is fourth in rebounds in NBA history - behind Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.The second-highest scoring German in NBA history is a long way behind Dirk Nowitzki. Detlef Schrempf played for Dallas, Indiana, Seattle and Portland between 1985 and 2001. His biggest success was reaching the NBA finals with the Seattle Supersonics in 1996.
