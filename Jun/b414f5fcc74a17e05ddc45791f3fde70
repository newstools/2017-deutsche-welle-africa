The Japanese government has passed a law that it claims is designed to punish anyone plotting or preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in the country, although the legislation has immediately been criticized by the UN and analysts who describe it as placing "handcuffs on democracy and civil liberties."The "conspiracy law" was passed by the Diet in an ill-tempered session that went into the early hours of Thursday morning, with thousands of protestors outside the building chanting slogans against the legislation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).Despite being heavily outnumbered in the chamber, the opposition parties put up a staunch fight against the legislation and were outraged when the government announced that it would by-pass a vote in the Upper House, accusing Abe of attempting to prevent the details of the bill from being closely examined.PM Abe claimed the legislation was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks in the run-up to and during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic GamesRenho, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, described the government's tactic as the "ultimate form of railroading."Abe, who survived a no-confidence motion against his government shortly after the conspiracy bill was enacted, claimed the legislation was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks in the run-up to and during the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.Olympics explanation"It is only three years until the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and I would like to ratify the treaty on organized crime as soon as possible so we can firmly cooperate with international society to prevent terrorism," Abe said.Read: Mass protests in Tokyo against controversial military billsCritics claim, however, that while the law has given the authorities the capability to prosecute 277 crimes as a conspiracy, few appear to have any directly link to terrorism. Instead, they point out, the statutes outlaw discussing going hunting for mushrooms in conservation areas, forging postage stamps, sit-in demonstrations and organizing an unlicensed bicycle race."This legislation has just given the police here sweeping new powers to crack down on all sorts of activities that, as far as I can see, have absolutely nothing to do with organized crime or terrorism," said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at the Japan campus of Temple University."The government has ignored parliamentary procedures to ram this through and I believe that most Japanese will be incredulous at the law as it has been delivered," Kingston told DW. "This can be used to curtail a person's right to privacy, the right to express dissent, the right to know and a person's freedom of expression.""They have placed handcuffs on democracy and civil liberties, and the ultimate irony is that they claim to be doing it in the interests of protecting people," he added.Celebration in the Japanese capital: Tokyo won the rights to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games after defeating fellow bidder Istanbul 60 to 36 votes in a second round of secret voting. Madrid, the other city competing to host the XXXII Olympiad, had been surprisingly eliminated in the first round of voting.The decision was also met with elation by the Japanese Olympic delegation in Buenos Aires. After wiping off tears of joy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who flew to the Argentinian capital from the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, said: "By hosting the 2020 Tokyo Games, we will create hope."Tokyo has promised 'compact Games' for athletes, fans and journalists, with 85 percent of the Olympic venues located only eight kilometers away from the Olympic Village, and hence in the heart of the city."Discover tomorrow" is the slogan of the 2020 Games. Future-oriented is also design of the Olympic Stadium by the Iraqi-British star architect Zaha Hadid, which is now set to be realized.So far, the Olympic Village only exists on paper, or to be exact, in pixels. This graphic shows the concept of the organizers: The 44-hectare village complex is to be constructed in the vicinity of the Ginza shopping and entertainment district and house some 17,000 beds.The current crisis at the crippled nuclear plant in Fukushima nearly cost Tokyo the Games. On election day, PM Abe had to reassure the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the situation was under control. Fukushima lies some 225 kilometers (140 miles) north of the Japanese capital.Tokyo is more than just a city, it is rather a country, considering that it is home to some nine million people, according to the latest population census. About 35 million people reside in the larger metropolitan area. This is only made possible through the city's numerous skyscrapers.In almost no other city on Earth are there so many people on the move as in Tokyo. The megacity has been praised for having a good transport network which is put to the test daily by millions of traffic participants. Around 80 percent of the people in the Japanese capital use trains such as this one transiting on the Yurikamome line.Tokyo's first Olympic Games were held in 1964, after being canceled in 1940 due to WWII. 5151 athletes from 93 countries took part in the event, which was opened by Emperor Hirohito.The Olympic Flame is coming back to Tokyo. Yoshinori Sakai, born in Hiroshima on the day the atomic bomb was dropped on the city, lit the flame in 1964, sending out a message for world peace. Author: Joscha Weber / gd Previous attemptsThe government has attempted to pass similar conspiracy bills four times previously, but all have fallen short in the Diet. To ensure this version won parliament's approval, the number of crimes it specified was reduced and the government played up the threat that terrorists pose to the safety of the 2020 Olympic Games. It also insists the new legislation was necessary to enable Japan to ratify the 2000 UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.Critics are far from convinced that the wide-ranging regulations will not simply be used to gag anyone who speaks out against the authorities in any way."The government is creating a surveillance state and has declared 277 new reasons for the authorities to be able to tap a telephone or carry out surveillance on someone," Kingston said."And there is a strong case for this legislation to be compared to the notorious 1925 Peace Preservation Law, which was used by the government of the day to round up communists and set Japan down the dark road to the militarism of the 1930s," he underlined.And that ties into Abe's desire to rewrite the constitution, which conservatives believe was imposed upon a defeated Japan by the vengeful Allies after the war. A section of the constitution echoes the 1948 International Declaration of Human Rights, although the LDP's 2012 manifesto said that section should be replaced with a passage that imposes duties and obligations on the Japanese people.

"It would take a sea-change in Japan's security environment and social cohesion for things to get so bad that the government would do what the opposition is suggesting they will use this law to do. It won't happen." Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://p.dw.com/p/2c1sS
