London police revealed on Friday that both the insulation and tiles used in the cladding on Grenfell Tower had failed all post-fire safety tests.Police Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said they were looking into whether the use of the two materials was illegal and were, therefore, considering whether to pursue manslaughter charges against those responsible.Read more: Combustible cladding on buildings similar to Grenfell Tower, says British PM Theresa May"Preliminary tests show the insulation samples collected from Grenfell Tower combusted soon after the test started," McCormack said.

Nevertheless, the manufacturer was doing further tests, while the UK government ordered an immediate technical examination of the model. Whirlpool said it would cooperate with the government's inquiry into the blaze."We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations," the company said in a statement. "Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy."As previously suspected, the fire was not started intentionally.With the freezer reportedly located close to an open window, the fire spread to the outside of the building before swiftly spreading upwards and consuming the 24-storey tower block.'Complete' bodies removed from charred ruinsAt least 79 people were killed in the blaze, although the number could still rise. Police on Friday said they had removed every "complete" body found in the charred remains of the tower, although forensic research would likely continue until the end of the year.However, the precise number of casualties may never be known. McCormack called on anyone with information on who might have been in the tower to come forward."What we haven't got is a picture of how many people might have been in there," said McCormack. "That's the number I'm really worried about."McCormack's comments followed London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pledge to seek an amnesty for people who may have been living in the tower illegally.Hundreds of buildings to be inspectedThe deadly blaze has stoked fears in the UK over how many other high-rise buildings are also covered in combustible cladding. Prime Minister Theresa May's office estimated that as many as 600 high-rise buildings could be at risk.Earlier on Thursday, May said combustible cladding had been found on "a number" of publicly owned high-rises similar to Grenfell Tower. An inquiry showed that the same cladding had been used on buildings in London, Manchester and Plymouth.Read more: Grief turns to anger as protesters march over London tower fire responseMay has launched a public inquiry as well as a criminal investigation into the fire.
