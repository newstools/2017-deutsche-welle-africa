He went on to work for a number of government agencies and defense contractors.

According to the affidavit, Mallory told the FBI he had come to believe that the individuals worked for Chinese intelligence, not a think tank.He also said they had given him a special communications device for transmitting documents, and that he had only used it to transfer two unclassified "white papers" he had written on US policy matters.But, the affidavit said, when FBI agents searched the device, they found other documents and messages that Mallory thought had been deleted. In one message, Mallory wrote to the suspected Chinese agent, "Your object is to gain information, and my object is to be paid."The agent responded: "My current object is to make sure your security and to try to reimburse you."The FBI said they found four classified documents on the device, including three labeled Top Secret. According to court documents, Mallory received around $25,000 from individuals he thought were Chinese operatives.nm/cmk (Reuters, AP)
