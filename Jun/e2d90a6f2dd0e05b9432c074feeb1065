The city's mayor, Stefan Schostok, officially returned the painting to R denberg's heirs on Tuesday. The return of the work, now worth about 160,000 euros ($180,500), can be seen as a "symbol of understanding," said Schostok.A victim of Hitler's 'Aryanization'Max R denberg, local politician in Hannover and bedspring factory owner, was dispossessed by the Nazis.
