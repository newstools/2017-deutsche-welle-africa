Syria's state news agency SANA said of the 672 inmates released on Saturday, 588 were let go from the main prison in Damascus. Ninety-one women were among those freed.Justice Minister Hisham al-Shaar said the prisoners had promised to accept the state's authority."They have been released after promising not to do anything against the nation's security or stability," SANA cited him as saying.Their freedom coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which this year begins Sunday and marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.'National reconciliation'Al-Shaar used the term "national reconciliation," which is often used to describe deals with rebel groups who either disarm or leave besieged areas of the country for other insurgent-held areas."It also aims at giving another chance to those who were previously misled so that they can lead a normal life again," the official added, in reference to those who took part in the 6-year armed rebellion against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.Another amnesty took place close to Raqqa, the "Islamic State" (IS) armed group's de-facto capital in Syria, which the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces hope to fully recapture in weeks.A council of rebel groups, set up to rule Raqqa when it falls, announced on Saturday it was releasing 200 low-ranking IS members that had been captured in recent months. The release came in response to a request from tribal leaders in the region. The Observatory said the IS members were not fighters, but rather held jobs in the civilian administration.
