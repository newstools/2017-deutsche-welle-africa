The death toll included 137 children.Key IS areas struckThe Observatory said the IS-held provinces of Deir Ezzor and Raqqa were the worst affected, with 222 civilians - including 84 children - killed in Deir Ezzor, along with 250 civilians - including 53 children - in Raqqa.

The intense bombardment backs an ongoing campaign by US-allied Syrian fighters seeking to capture Raqqa from the jihadists.Last month, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said President Donald Trump had instructed the Pentagon to "annihilate" IS in Syria in a bid to prevent foreign fighters from returning home.The coalition insists it takes every measure to avoid hitting civilians, but in its most recent report, it admitted it had "unintentionally killed" 484 civilians recently in both Iraq and Syria. But observers say the number is much higher.In May, the United Nations accused the US-led alliance of not taking adequate care to prevent civilian deaths in Syria.The coalition has also come in for severe criticism for hitting civilians during an aerial bombing in the Iraqi city of Mosul in March. More than 100 civilians were killed in a single strike, leading to a temporary halt of the offensive.
