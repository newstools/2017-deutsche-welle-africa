On Thursday, Nawaz Sharif will become the first head of government in Pakistan to appear before an investigating agency.The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was constituted by the country's Supreme Court in April to look into Sharif and his family's links with offshore companies mentioned in the so-called Panama Papers.In April last year, the prime minister found himself in a precarious position following the "revelations" made by the famed Panama Papers. Leaked documents showed that three of Sharif's children had links with offshore companies that owned properties in London. Sharif denies any wrongdoing.Apex court judges ruled against his disqualification as prime minister in a judgment made two months ago, but said the investigations would carry on.Sharif promised to cooperate with the JIT, and his decision to appear before the commission is a good omen for Pakistan's democracy.PM Sharif denies corruption allegationsPM under pressureOpposition parties, particularly Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice, PTI), has once again demanded Sharif's resignation over corruption allegations. For the past two years, the premier has found himself struggling to ward off pressure from the PTI and his country's powerful military.Despite a persistent media campaign against Sharif, and street protests organized by Khan's PTI party, the premier has managed to survive - so far.But many in the South Asian country, especially progressive groups and activists, believe the "undemocratic" forces are bent on ousting an elected civilian leader who wants to forge closer ties with Pakistan's archrival India and increase trade links in the region.Opposition parties and supporters of Khan and the military relish the fact that Sharif has to present himself for the JIT investigation. To them, it is a sign that the premier is edging closer to his ouster.But Sharif could have avoided the JIT hearing as past prime ministers and military rulers have done. By agreeing to comply with the investigation committee's order, Sharif has set a praiseworthy precedent - of respect for the rule of law.Opposition leader Imran Khan has kept the pressure on PM Sharif for the past two yearsTwo sets of rulesWhile Sharif faces the possibility of being disqualified as premier and even a jail term, former military dictator Pervez Musharraf, who is facing multiple cases relating to treason and accusations linked with the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was allowed to leave the country in March last year. Analysts say it all comes down to the fact that Musharraf was a former military chief and that there are two different sets of rules for the civilian and military rulers in the Islamic country. Anti-government media channels and commentators accuse Sharif and other politicians of being "extremely corrupt" but gloss over the fact that the military is not a "sacred cow" when it comes to graft cases.Security experts point out that the corruption in the Pakistani military is as rampant as in any other state institution. It keeps control over a sizeable share of the country's budget and is not answerable to the civilian government over its expenditures, they say.While opposition leader Imran Khan and pro-military media commentators have already declared Sharif a "culprit," it is yet to be seen what the Supreme Court-established Joint Investigation Team concludes in the Panama Papers case.Sharif might lose the case but the democracy in Pakistan is surely to gain due to the premier's show of respect for the rule of law.
