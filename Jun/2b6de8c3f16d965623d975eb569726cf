Germany 3-1 Cameroon (Demirbay 48', Werner 66', 81' - Aboubakar 78')Timo Werner scored twice as Germany beat Cameroon to set up a Confederations Cup semifinal against Mexico.With Germany winning and Chile failing to beat Australia in Sunday s other game, it means Germany will avoid Group A winners Portugal.Germany enjoyed the better of the first half and created the clearer chances, but Cameroon had their moments too and showed just enough to suggest they might make a game of it most notably with Marc-Andre Ter Stegen forced into tipping over from Andre-Frank Anguissa just before the break.But the game exploded into life just after the restart and it was the world champions who drew first blood with a goal of the highest quality.Kerem Demirbay produced a brilliant strike after a beautiful assist from captain Julian Draxler, whose backheel set up the Hoffenheim forward, who powered in his shot into the top corner from outside the box.That spurred Germany into action and Joachim L w s side almost doubled their lead a minute later through Demirbay again, but this time he could only fire over from close range.Cameroon goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa kept the African champions in the game with a vital double save, first taking the ball off the toes of Timo Werner and then getting up quickly to deny Joshua Kimmich on the rebound.That show of athleticism gave Cameroon a boost and, for a few minutes, they were putting Germany under some pressure. Nicolas Ngamelu and Cameroon veteran forward Vincent Aboubakar each went close, but Cameroon s resurgence was stopped in its tracks as they were reduced to ten men in controversial circumstances.After initially sending off Sebastien Siani the wrong man - for a high foot on Emre Can and ordering a video review of the decision, the referee ordered a review of the review, before establishing that it was a case of mistaken identity and brandishing a red card to Ernest Mabouka, the true culprit.Cameroon barely had time to readjust to having ten men before Germany doubled their lead with a slick second through Werner. The RB Leipzig forward stooped low to reach Joshua Kimmich s pinpoint cross and control his header into the bottom corner.Cameroon pulled one back through Aboubakar, with a goal that Ter Stegen will not want to see again. Aboubakar flicked on Ngamelu s cross from the right, and the Barcelona keeper made a feeble attempt to block it as the ball went through his arms.Luckily for Ter Stegen, Werner was in ruthless mood at the other end and put the result beyond doubt with a sweet, first time finish after substitutes Julian Brandt and Benjamin Heinrichs combined down the right.Germany will face Mexico in Sochi on Thursday as L w s experimental team looks to advance to the final on Sunday July 2. Chile 1-1 Australia (Rodriguez 67' - Troisi 42')Chile rallied to sneak a point against Australia but their failure to win means they will face European champions Portugal - not Mexico - on Wednesday.Juan Antonio Pizzi's side found it hard to contain an Australian side who were giving their all to secure an unlikely place in the semifinals.Former Bayer Leverkusen winger Robbie Kruse teed up James Troisi who finished confidently in the 42nd minute to give Ange Postecoglou's side a deserved lead.The Socceroos passed up a handful of clear chances to extend their lead, Tomi Juric and Kruse failing to finish from close range in the second half.The South American champions duly punished their opponents with a ruthless end to the second period as Martin Rodriguez powered home his first international goal.
