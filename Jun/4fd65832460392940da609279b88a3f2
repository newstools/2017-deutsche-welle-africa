Energy labels are hugely exaggerating the efficiency of televisions, fridge-freezers and dishwashers - with some appliances consuming almost twice as much energy as they claim to.That's according to a survey of European Union products, which show that domestic appliances seriously fail to measure up to their purported energy efficiency savings when tested outside the laboratory in real-world conditions. The findings are reminiscent of Dieselgate.The tests revealed that the current outdated official test formats on which appliances' color-coded A to G gradings have been based are "vulnerable to misuse."The study further warned of the growing potential for goods to outwit tests, saying that "as appliances and products become increasingly sophisticated and 'smart,' they may also become better able to detect specific test conditions set out in the EHTS [European harmonized test standards] and adjust their performance and energy consumption."If a test is very similar to real life, it becomes more difficult for software to differentiate between test conditions and real life."The European Commission voted last week to modify its labeling scheme, including making a single "A" class'Defeat devices' to cheat the tests?Researchers from a coalition of environmental and energy efficiency organizations looked at three groups of appliances sold in the EU: TVs, fridge-freezers, and dishwashers.They found that under more realistic test conditions - such as switching on modern TV features like ultra-high definition - four out of seven TVs surveyed consumed significantly more energy than under the standard laboratory conditions. One increased its usage by 130 percent.The standard official test employs a video clip in use since 2007 - considered "obsolete" by the study's authors, as it fails to mirror current broadcast patterns. So researchers created their own video clip more representative of today's TV viewing.Based on how one particular TV model increased its consumption by 47 percent when playing the video clip, the report said that "given the magnitude of this power increase, and the fact that none of the other models exhibited the same behavior, this model stands out as potentially detecting and adjusting its behavior to reduce average power consumption."The authors stopped short from comparing the findings to Dieselgate, the scandal involving Volkswagen cars where installed "defeat devices" cheated emissions tests by making the vehicles appear far less polluting than they really are.High-tech televisions have functions that send energy consumption soaringFrancisco Zuloaga, senior consultant for consumer website Topten.eu - which contributed to the report - told DW that the study was "definitely not" suggesting that defeat devices were put into the household products they tested. "We can't prove that," he said, adding that Dieselgate comparisons "go too far.""We can only say there's a difference between the tests we did and the tests that the official authorities did - that's all," he told DW. "Our tests are more representative of real life."Jack Hunter, spokesman for the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), another co-author of the report, told DW that regulators in the United Kingdom and Sweden had already complained to the European Commission that TV sets seemed to cut their energy use when they recognize the standard official clip being played."This is one of the reasons why we looked into it," Hunter told DW. "We found behavior we thought was suspicious."But we can't prove it - it's extremely hard to prove."Governmental authorities had complained about an apparent disconnect between labeled and actual energy consumptionCalls for further investigationThe study also found that five TV sets deactivated their energy-saving features when changing default picture settings, without warning the consumer. For two of those five models, energy-saving features were greyed-out, and couldn't be re-enabled without a factory reset, despite these features having contributed to the energy label rating.Dishwashers are only tested on an efficient - but infrequently-used - eco mode in official test cycles. When tested under more realistic conditions, dishwashers surveyed in the report used up to 73 percent more energy than claimed.No brands are named in the report, which investigated 20 products in total: seven televisions, 10 fridge-freezers and three dishwashers.The report's authors cautioned that it is not a comprehensive survey, because sample sizes were limited to one model due to time and budget constraints.But they have passed on the report's findings to market surveillance authorities, for which EU member states are responsible under European Union regulations, and urged them to carry out further investigation.Study authors emphasized that they could not prove the existence of "defeat devices"Not 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'The Ecodesign Directive is the main EU policy instrument for improving the energy efficiency of products. It compels manufacturers to improve efficiency and phase out products that no longer meet the requirements.The directive uses energy labels to help consumers buy more efficient products that are cheaper to run. Ecodesign innovations are expected to cut around 9 percent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, and 15 percent by 2030.The policies are also expected to reduce the average home energy bill by nearly 500 euros per year by 2020, according to the appliance efficiency study."In reality, such savings will only be realized if consumers trust the label and continue buying energy efficient products," the study warns.Zuloaga said, however, that he hoped that consumers reading reports of the survey's findings "will not throw the baby out with the bathwater.""The labels are a good tool, and it's working well," he told DW. "But we think they can be made even better."Consumers may feel misled about the over-inflated energy savings claimed by some appliancesEuropean Commission to study report s findingsA spokesperson for the European Commission told DW that it has recently improved European laws in energy labeling, saying: "As part of the new rules, harmonized testing standards will be designed aiming to simulate real-life usage as far as possible."The commission told DW that it was taking "good note" of the product report.It acknowledged that the real-life energy performance of products may differ from those under test conditions."This is due to the fact that test methods have to be reliable, comparable and reproducible, and cannot address every possible use of a product by consumers," the spokesperson told DW.The spokesperson added that the revised energy labeling agreed upon by the European Parliament last week "contains clear obligations for suppliers as regards the use of 'defeat devices' [which is forbidden] and the need to inform consumers about possible detrimental effects of software updates on the energy performance of the product."The "GoSun Stove" is reminiscent of an electric grill - but it doesn't require electricity. The stove uses solar power, with the energy from solar panels used to heat pipes on the inside. The temperature get up to 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit), which according to the manufacturer would allow you to cook an eight-person meal in one hour. Bon app tit!The new shower head developed by "Hydrao" makes it easier to save water: once you've used more than 50 liters, the shower head starts to glow, and records further water usage. And it does all that without batteries or an external power supply, because the necessary energy is generated through the flow of water.It looks like a mix of Bat Mobile and racecar: the FFZERO1. The vehicle manufactured by the Faraday company is electronic, and currently just a vision for the future. It will be some time before someone can actually go for a whirl with these futuristic wheels - which would run emissions-free.Charging your phone without an outlet nearby will be possible in the future thanks to "Jaq MyFC." The device, about as small as a regular smart phone, works like a mini-power plant: It tranforms salt, water and a metal oxide into hydrogen, which a fuel cell uses to generate electricity. This would make the smart phone user's desperate hunt for outlets a thing of the past.Do we still have cheese in the fridge? And when does the milk expire? If these things only come to mind once you're already at the grocery store, the "family hub refrigerator" can help. It has a large display on the outside and a camera on the inside, which records images accessible via an app. A barcode scanner delivers expiration dates directly to your phone. This could help reduce food waste!The coffee machine developed by Berlin start-up "Bonaverde" not only brews the coffee, it also grinds and roasts the beans. Owners of the coffeemakers buy the raw, green beans directly from a farmer listed by Bonaverde. That's good for the environment because no roasting plants are necessary, reducing transport routes."Gogoro" e-scooters have so far mostly been seen in Taiwan. But now the two-wheelers are set to take on Europe as well. The distinguishing trait of the "Gogoro": instead of having to charge its batteries for several hours, the driver exchanges dead batteries for fully charged ones at special "Gogoro" changing stations.
