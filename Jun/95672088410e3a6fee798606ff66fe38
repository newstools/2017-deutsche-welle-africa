This week, we have another eco@africa show packed full of green news and ideas from Africa and Europe.At the top of the program, we visit western Senegal, where villagers are fighting the rising tide by looking back to traditional methods. Staying in the West African country, DW talks to Senegal's President Macky Sall about his country's green energy ambitions. Then we switch to Germany to find out how scientists are trying to reintroduce a prehistoric fish to the country. The sturgeon has been around for over 200 million years but disappeared from Germany about 40 years ago. In Nigeria, we talk to residents in a settlement close to the country's capital Lagos. There the sea has eroded several hundred meters of land. Villagers are worried about losing their homes and are trying to protect them with sandbags and coconut trees. After that we look to Germany again where researchers are investigating what hotter temperatures and less rainfall will mean for the country's farmers. Finally, we head to Africa's Lake Victoria, where farmers are cashing in by fighting invasive water hyacinth. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com
