US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Republican party's leadership was "still working toward getting at least 50 people in a comfortable place," referring to the missing support from senators needed to pass a health care overhaul promised by President Donald Trump.Even with a two-seat majority in the Senate, McConnell conceded he had struggled to get enough Republicans to back the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. But he insisted the proposed law was far from dead.The bill is now set to go to a vote after the July 4 public holiday in the US.

It will just take a little bit longer."Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives was forced to pull the first version of the bill due to a lack of support.
