The EMSC put the quake's magnitude slightly higher, at 6.3. Tremors were felt in the coastal city of Izmir as well as the city of Istanbul, some 330 kilometers away. The EMSC logged more than a dozen aftershocks following the quake, none of them exceeding magnitude 5."We will be seeing the aftershocks of this in the coming hours, days and weeks," said Haluk Ozener, head of Turkey's Kandilli Observatory.

In the small town of Plomari in the south, a church steeple was damaged in the quake and cracks appeared on the walls of several houses, said deputy mayor Manolis Armenakas.The quake also caused several landslides that have partially blocked roads, Armenakas said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.

In 1999, a huge earthquake near the northwestern city of Izmit - east of Istanbul - killed more than 17,000 people. rs/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
