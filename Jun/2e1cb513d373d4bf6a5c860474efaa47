Germany's nuclear power operators scored a major victory on Wednesday when the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe declared a tax on nuclear fuel rods as illegal, enabling utilities Eon, RWE and EnBW to claim back about six billion euros ($6.76 billion).Shares in the three German energy majors jumped between 2.5 percent and 3.2 percent on the news, with traders citing the prospect of them getting their money back.In a long-awaited verdict closely watched by investors and analysts, Germany's top court said the tax, which was imposed between 2011 and 2016, was "formally illegal and void." The verdict overrules a decision by the European Court of Justice last year saying the tax did not breach European Union laws.

The nuclear fuel tax, however, wasn't stopped until 2016.The verdict marks the second victory by German utilities over the country's nuclear policy. The court in December ruled that a decision to shut down all nuclear plants following Japan's Fukushima disaster violated some of their property rights. The decision has paved a way for the utilities to claim back stranded investments and power production rights.
