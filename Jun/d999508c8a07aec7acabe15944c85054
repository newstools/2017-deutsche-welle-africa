Mexico 2-1 Russia (Araujo 31', Lozano 52' - Samedov 24')Hosts Russia are out of the Confederations Cup following a 2-1 defeat by Mexico in Kazan.The hosts took a deserved lead through Alexander Samedov midway through the first half, the midfielder capitalizing on confusion in the Mexican box to fire home and put Russia provisionally top of Group A.But the celebrations were cut short just five minutes later when defender Nestor Araujo sent a back-post header looping over the flailing Igor Akinfeev in the Russian goal.If there were questions about Akinfeev's positioning for the equalizer, there was no doubt he was at fault for Mexico's second just after half-time. Hector Herrera cleared on the edge of his box, sending the ball flying high down the pitch where Akinfeev simply had to meet it.But the Russian goalkeeper hesitated, allowing Hirzing Lozano to out-jump him and nod the ball into the net from 20 yards. Hector Moreno looked like he'd put the game to bed for Mexico but the video assistant referee correctly ruled his strike offside and Russia survived.Despite being reduced to ten men when Yuriy Zhirkov was dismissed for a second bookable offence, the hosts continued to attack, substitute Igor Smolnikov blazing over from close range as Russia's golden chance went begging.

The only blot for Portugal was a booking for defender Pepe - his second of the tournament - to leave him suspended for the semifinal.
