German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron late Sunday for his party's success in the first round of parliamentary elections.Macron's centrist La Republique En Marche! (LREM) party won more than 30 percent of the vote, putting it and ally Modem on track to take between 415 and 455 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly."My heartfelt congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on the great success of his party in the first ballot," Merkel was quoted as saying by government spokesman Steffen Seibert on Twitter."A strong vote for reforms," she said, referring to Emmanuel's promised labor and economic reforms that could strengthen the Paris-Berlin alliance.LREM's win is one of the largest parliamentary majorities in the history of France's Fifth Republic, allowing Macron to implement a range of reforms he promised ahead of the presidential election a month ago.Macron had called for a reform of the European Union, including a strengthening of the Eurozone through a common budget, as well as introducing "new executive powers" in the euro region, a "Euro chamber" and a "Euro commissioner."During a meeting between the pair in Berlin last month, Merkel said they both wished to develop a "road map" to strengthen the EU and the eurozone.
