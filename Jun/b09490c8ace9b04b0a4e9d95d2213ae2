Officials said the bus driver, angry at losing overtime wages, had set the fire.The rise in attacks has prompted officials to tighten security around many schools, by posting guards armed with truncheons and installing gates and other barriers.China maintains tight control over firearms and most attacks are carried out using knives, axes or homemade explosives.tj/se (dpa, AFP, AP)
