Addressing parliament on Thursday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the&nbsp;Brussels "spring summit would usually focus on the economy,"&nbsp;but, in light&nbsp;of Brexit&nbsp;and the refugee crisis, other topics would also be on the agenda.Merkel again mooted her plan of a 'two-speed' EU in front of the BundestagFaced with the reluctance of some Eastern European members to cede national freedoms to Brussels so soon after shaking off Soviet rule, Merkel said the Union can "progress&nbsp;without excluding the EU members."The EU is a great "success story," Merkel said, adding that the UK's impending exit from the 28-member bloc should be a "wake up call" for the Union.Highlighting the economic growth in the EU, the chancellor warned Germany that the country will prosper, "only if Europe is doing well."According to the EU's statistics office, Eurostat, Greece was the only member state to be in negative territory in the last quarter of 2016, with GDP declining by 1.1 percent compared to the last quarter of the previous year.EU defense against protectionismTuring to transatlantic matters, Merkel praised&nbsp;the EU's CETA trade agreement with Canada, as she urged Europe avoid&nbsp;"isolating&nbsp;itself." In an indirect attack on the protectionist course of US President Donald Trump, Merkel added that the EU&nbsp;would defend itseld against "unfair" protectionism.With regard to the refugee crisis, the chancellor admitted that&nbsp;"there is no doubt that we have made progress, but the EU's asylum system needs to be reformed."Reflecting on the&nbsp;situation of refugees in Greece, she said there is "nothing to gloss over."'Nazi comparisons must stop'Despite an ongoing diplomatic dispute with Ankara over the cancellation of referendum rallies in Germany, Merkel also defended the refugee agreement with Turkey.&nbsp;"Without such agreements, we would have to accept illegal migration, which would not help anyone," she said, adding that the relationship between the two countries is "difficult but important."In late 2014, with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country, the exodus of Syrians intensified. At the same time, others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Niger and Kosovo.Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in border-town camps in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan since 2011. By 2015, with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children, more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield.In 2015 an estimated 1.5 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the "Balkan route". The Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel within much of the EU, was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations. Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats. In April 2015, 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast. This was to be just one of many similar tragedies - by the end of the year, nearly 4,000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing.Countries along the EU's external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals. Fences were erected in Hungary, Slovenia, Macedonia and Austria. Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls.Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's "open-door" refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe. By September 2016, Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria.In early 2016, the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey. The deal has been criticised by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkey's potential accession to the EU.With anti-immigration sentiment in Europe growing, governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis. Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed. Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end, and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise.

Nazi comparisons only lead to misery. This needs to stop," she said.Erdogan made the comment after several German&nbsp;municipalities canceled events in which Turkish Cabinet ministers had&nbsp;planned to address rallies in Germany in support of a controversial referendum on April 16.A "yes" vote on constitutional reform would expand the powers of the Turkish&nbsp;president. About 1.4 million people of Turkish descent&nbsp;living in Germany are eligible to vote in the referendum.#FreeDeniz Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2YmqjIn light of the arrest of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel&nbsp;last month,&nbsp;Merkel went&nbsp;on to criticize the restriction of press freedom in Turkey, vowing that the&nbsp;German government would work to ensure that Yucel is released.But it was not in the interest of Germany to break off contact with Turkey, the chancellor said, adding that "we want to live with our basic values as we think fit."Amid concerns over tensions between right-wing Turks in Germany and&nbsp;supporters&nbsp;of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), however, Merkel said:&nbsp;"We want to do everything we can to ensure that non-Turkic conflicts are brought into this co-existence. This is a matter close to our heart."Turks are "part of our country, and they contribute to the prosperity of our country," she said.
