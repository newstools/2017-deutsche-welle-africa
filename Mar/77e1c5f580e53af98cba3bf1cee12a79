Families would also get extra help, with a plan for lower childcare costs, along with a boost to child welfare payments.Germany's FDP wants to regain a foothold in Germany's Bundestag after being wiped out at the last electionLindner said the party would seek to strengthen competition between schools and other education institutes and create a digital ministry to expand fast internet access nationwide.The FDP's manifesto calls for the state's interests in Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telecom to be sold off, and new immigration rules to welcome "qualified and hardworking people" to the country, while maintaining the country's policy on asylum seekers.Lindner also said the party would allocate extra cash to improve national security in the wake of recent terror attacks, and called for reforms to the EU that would see Brussels focus more on international than national issues.'Comeback imminent'The FDP party chief wouldn't give a number of targeted seats for this election or discuss possible coalition partners, but he was convinced his centrist party will return to the Bundestag in September.Six months ahead of the federal election, the FDP is currently polling between five and seven percent.Between 2009 and 2013, the FDP was a minority partner in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition alongside the Christian Democrats (CDU) and its Bavarian partners, the Christian Social Union (CSU).But in a dramatic change of fortunes, it lost its 93 seats in the 2013 federal election and also failed to make the 5 percent minimum requirement to qualify for list representation in parliament under Germany's system of proportional representation.
