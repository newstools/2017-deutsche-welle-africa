That&nbsp;is a lower than in previous years amid a slowing economy and tensions in the South China Sea. The Chinese defense budget grew 10.1 percent in 2015 and 7.6 percent in 2016.The trend of reducing defense budget increases is "the new normal, an acknowledgement that Chinese growth is plateauing as a whole," Alexander Neill, a senior fellow of the Asia-Pacific security for the International Institute for Strategic Studies told AP.Total defense spending would make up approximately 1.3 percent of projected Chinese GDP in 2017, according to NPC spokeswoman Fu Ying.China's defense budget is the second largest in the world, but trails far behind the US. China's defense budget is expected to grow to $233 billion (219 million euros) by 2020, while the US defense budget topped $600 billion in 2016.Taiwan navy soldiers in a military drillTaiwan and Hong KongLi's prepared speech also made it clear that China will oppose and contain Taiwan independence.&nbsp;Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party have mooted&nbsp;the island's formal independence. As a result, Beijing cut off an official dialogue mechanism with Taipei."We will never tolerate any activity, in any form or name, which attempts to separate Taiwan from the motherland," Li said in a report made available before he made his speech.&nbsp;Li also said the idea of Hong Kong independence would lead nowhere. Beijing would ensure that the principle of "one country, two systems" was applied in Hong Kong and Macao "without being bent or distorted".The NPC runs concurrently with a separate body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which started Friday.
