Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party looked set to clinch a landslide victory in India's most populous state, giving his leadership a ringing endorsement, early results on Saturday showed.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 301 out of 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh state, far more than the 202 seats required to form a government, the Election Commission said. Nearly half the votes have been counted from multi-phased elections held in February and March, with final results expected late on Saturday.A state of more than 220 million people, Uttar Pradesh was viewed as a referendum&nbsp;on Modi's decision last November to withdraw high-value banknotes from circulation in a bid to stamp out corruption.&nbsp;The initial rollout of the plan to withdraw 86 percent of currency from circulation caused economic problems and cash shortages that impacted the poor. But the government was able to address many of the problems last month as voting got underway."This is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's corruption-free administration and welfare measures for the poor," Modi's campaign manager, Amit Shah, said in a tweet.The opposition Congress party and its ally, the Samajwadi Party, had hoped to capitalize on voter grievances. But early election results showed Congress, led in the state by the party vice president Rahul Gandhi, would get only nine seats. The Samajwadi Party was slated to pick up 56 seats, a severe blow for a party that has ruled the state since 2012.BJP was also on course for a victory in Uttarakhand state, where it was ahead in 56 out of 70 seats."The BJP has reached new heights in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh states and changed the political picture of the country," said India's home minister, Rajnath Singh.Congress party faired better in Punjab state, where it was on track to gain 69 of 117 seats. Electoral battles in western Goa state and northeastern Manipur state were too close to call, with BJP and Congress running neck and neck.Victories in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh would have an impact on the upper house of parliament, where number of Modi's reforms, including a national sales tax, have stalled.Its make-up is based on parties' strength at the state level and the BJP is currently a minority.cw/rc&nbsp;(AFP, AP, Reuters)&nbsp;
