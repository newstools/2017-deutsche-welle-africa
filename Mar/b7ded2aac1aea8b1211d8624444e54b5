Billions of dollars in funding is needed to help millions of people facing largely man-made disasters in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria, the United Nations humanitarian chief said on Friday"We are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations," UN&nbsp;humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien warned the U.N. Security Council as he detailed the situation in the conflict-hit countries."To be precise we need 4.4 billion dollars by July, and that's a detailed cost, not a negotiating number," he said. In addition to funds, he urged for aid groups to be guaranteed "safe and unimpeded access" to deliver humanitarian aid.Yemen hit hardestO'Brien noted that the largest humanitarian crisis is currently in Yemen where 18.8 million people - two-thirds of the population - need aid. Another seven million people are hungry and do not know where their next meal will come from.

He also noted that the famine threatening the world's newest nation is "man-made."He urged for the Security Council and the international community to quickly intervene."It is all preventable," he said. "It is possible to avert this crisis, to avert these famines, to avert these looming human catastrophes."Without the assistance, however, "many people will predictably die from hunger, livelihoods will be lost, and political gains that have been hard-won over the last few years will be reversed."rs/ rc (AP, dpa) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Yn7M
