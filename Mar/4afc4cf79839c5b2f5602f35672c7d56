German police confirmed on Friday that a Turkish referendum rally, due to take place on Sunday in Frechen, on the outskirts of Cologne, would&nbsp;be scrapped as "the contract between the owner of the event hall and the organizer excludes political events."Turkish Minister for Economic Affairs, Nihat Zeybekci, was set to lead the rally where he hoped to garner the support of German-Turks&nbsp; ahead of a&nbsp;controversial referendum taking place on April 16.

A thorough search of the building, however, found&nbsp;no explosives.Warning from AnkaraIn light of the cancellations, Turkey's Foreign Ministry summoned Germany's ambassador to express the government's disapproval.&nbsp;Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused Germany of double standards, saying that Ankara would not be "intimidated."Germany "gives lectures on democracy," but then implements double standards on freedom of speech and assembly, Cavusoglu said. Referencing a Kurdish rally in Cologne last year, he accused Berlin of allowing the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to organize in Germany."If you want to continue relations, you [Germany] need to learn how to behave towards us. We will respond without hesitation," Cavusoglu said without providing details on what actions Ankara might take.Deniz Yucel was arrested two weeks ago on terrorism-related charges'Bitter and disappointing'The ongoing dispute over Yucel's detainment&nbsp;is just the latest in a flurry of issues straining ties between Turkey and Germany.&nbsp;These range from Turkey's crackdown on civil society after last July's failed coup, through alleged orders for Turkish authorities to spy in German schools, Turkey's conflict with Kurds in the south and east, the German parliament's decision last year to dub the World War I-era deaths of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as "genocide," and the continual tension between Ankara and Berlin - particularly over Turkey's large diaspora in Germany.Yucel, a journalist for the German newspaper "Die Welt,"&nbsp;was detained by Turkish authorities on February 14.&nbsp;The 43-year-old, who has&nbsp;penned several articles critical of the Turkish government's treatment of ethnic Kurds,&nbsp;has been in jail ever since, pending his trial on terrorism-related charges.His arrestprompted public demonstrations&nbsp;and uproar among&nbsp;politicians and&nbsp;fellow journalists, with&nbsp;Chancellor Angela Merkel describing his detainment as "bitter and disappointing."ksb/msh (AFP, dpa)
