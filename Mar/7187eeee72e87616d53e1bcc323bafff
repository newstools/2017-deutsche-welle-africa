Belgrade opened accession talks three years ago after years of delay&nbsp;due to the fallout from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.Banners reading "Serbia doesn't trust Brussels" dotted the room.Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the SRS, said the chants sent "a clear message that Serbia doesn't want to enter the EU, but wants integration with Russia."
