Despite Brussels warning&nbsp;Ankara&nbsp;to avoid "exacerbating" the situation&nbsp;over Turkey's demands to hold political rallies in the EU, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hit out at the Netherlands on Tuesday, by holding them responsbile for Europe's&nbsp;worst mass killing since World War II,Referring to a Dutch battalion of United Nations&nbsp;peacekeepers who failed to halt the slaughter by Bosnian Serb forces&nbsp;of thousands of&nbsp;Muslim men and boys in eastern Bosnia in&nbsp;1995, Erdogan said: "We know the&nbsp;Netherlands and the Dutch from the Srebrenica massacre. We know how&nbsp;rotten their character is from their massacre of 8,000 Bosnians&nbsp;there."

German authorities have also taken measures to limit such rallies but,&nbsp;to a lesser extent.Erdogan accused Merkel on Tuesday of attacking Turkey the same way Dutch&nbsp;police used dogs and water cannon to Turkish disperse protesters&nbsp;outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam.The Turkish President said Merkel&nbsp;was "no different from the Netherlands,"&nbsp;and urged emigre Turks&nbsp;to not vote for "the government and the racists" in upcoming&nbsp;European elections."Europe is too important a continent to be abandoned to&nbsp;the mercy of the bandit states," Erdogan said.Nazi slursPreviously, Erdogan accused the German chancellor&nbsp;of "supporting terrorists,"&nbsp;after saying that both Germany and Netherlands acted like Nazis."Mrs Merkel, why are you hiding terrorists in your country? Why are you not doing anything?" Erdogan said in an interview, accusing her of refusing to respond to 4,500 dossiers sent by Ankara on terror suspects.Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert meanwhile said that the accusations against her were clearly "absurd.""The chancellor has no intention of taking part in a game of provocation," he added.The Turkish referendumErdogan's belligerent course comes as Dutch Premier Mark Rutte (r.) gets ready to hold elections, which could possibly result in him losing his mandateThe Netherlands responded angrily to Erdogan's repeated claims of Nazism over the referendum dispute. The country, Germany's neighbor, was bombed and occupied by German forces during World War II."Nazism, we can call this Neo-nazism. A new Nazism tendency," Erdogan said again on Monday.His aggressive rhetoric comes with just one month to go to the referendum date. Expatriate Turkish voters could make all the difference in the plebiscite that, if passed, would greatly expand Erdogan's powers.

Turkey banned the Dutch ambassador from the country and stopped all high-level political discussions. The escalation came on the eve of general elections in the Netherlands.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim meanwhile also threatened to cancel the refugee deal struck between Turkey and the European Union one year ago, which has helped in keeping the number of migrants arriving in Germany and elsewhere in Europe at bay.
