Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of "supporting terrorists,"&nbsp;as the diplomatic row between Turkey and the EU threatened to spiral out of control."Mrs Merkel, why are you hiding terrorists in your country? Why are you not doing anything?" Erdogan said in an interview, accusing her of refusing to respond to 4,500 dossiers sent by Ankara on terror suspects.Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert meanwhile said that the accusations against her were clearly "absurd""The chancellor has no intention of taking part in a game of provocation," he added.The Turkish referendumErdogan also attacked Merkel for her public backing of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in the ongoing diplomatic crisis with the Netherlands, which started when the country refused to let Turkish ministers hold political rallies there ahead of a referendum in Turkey to be held on April 16. German authorities have also taken measures to limit such rallies but to a lesser extent.Erdogan's belligerent course comes as Dutch Premier Mark Rutte (r.) gets ready to hold elections, which could possibly result in him losing his mandateErdogan had repeatedly accused NATO ally Netherlands of acting like the Nazis in comments that sparked outrage in the country which had been bombed and occupied by German forces during World War II."Nazism, we can call this Neo-nazism. A new Nazism tendency," Erdogan said again on Monday.His aggressive rhetoric comes with just one month to go to the referendum date. Expatriate Turkish voters could make all the difference in the plebiscite that, if passed, would greatly expand Erdogan's powers.

The escalation came on the eve of general elections in the Netherlands.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim meanwhile also threatened to cancel the refugee deal struck between Turkey and the European Union one year ago, which has helped in keeping the number of migrants arriving in Germany and elsewhere in Europe at bay.
