European Union member states are not obliged&nbsp;to issue so-called humanitarian visas at their foreign missions, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled on Tuesday.The court handed down its ruling in connection with a case brought by a Syrian family of five from Aleppo. The family had initially applied for a visa to Belgium at the Belgian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. They then planned to travel&nbsp;to Belgium where they would apply for asylum.The application was denied, however, with the&nbsp;Belgian Foreign Office arguing in court that the family wanted to stay longer than the 90 days granted with the&nbsp;visa.

Between July 2015 and February 2017, some 14,422 people from Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon were able to enter the EU and apply for asylum using this method.ksb/tj (dpa)
