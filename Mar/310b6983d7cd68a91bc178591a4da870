Chinese officials in Germany are warning of a diplomatic row that could start over a seemingly innocuous clothing line.The Chinese Embassy in Berlin reiterated its calls on Friday for the German company Spreadshirt to stop selling the shirts, which come emblazoned with jokey English slogans like "Save a dog, eat a Chinese" and "Save a shark, eat a Chinese." A third T-shirt depicts two Chinese-style characters having sex, with the caption "Now I understand Chinese" written underneath.The embassy released a short statement calling for the website to halt the sale of the shirts and to apologize. "At the same time, we demand from the German supervisory authorities to exercise their duties with regard to the business activities of the company and the website so that the friendly feelings between our two people will not be damaged."
