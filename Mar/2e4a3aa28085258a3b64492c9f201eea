Borussia M nchengladbach's Mo Dahoud will join Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season for an undisclosed fee, confirmed both clubs this afternoon.The yellow-and-blacks have held off competition from Premier League side Liverpool to add another impressive young player to their ranks for next season. The 21-year-old was approaching the final year of his contract at Borussia-Park, which comes&nbsp;to an end in 2018."Mo Dahoud is a highly talented and exciting player for central midfield, who we have been watching intensively for several years. He has already demonstrated that he can play at the top level," said Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc in a club statement.Plucked from Fortuna D sseldorf's academy in 2010, Dahoud has been nurtured by Gladbach and is the latest in a string of homegrown talents to reach the Bundesliga. The German U21 international has made 76 appearances since his league debut in 2015."Gladbach has shown in recent years that we can compensate well for losing players of his quality," added head coach Dieter Hecking.&nbsp;"This transfer shows that we're doing good work. Our task is to develop talents and be successful," Max Eberl told a media conference earlier.Dahoud is Borussia Dortmund's second confirmed signing for the next season following Omer Toprak's move from Bayer Leverkusen.
