Though much of the winter was mild and dry, a late season winter storm is bringing up to two feet (0.61 meters) of snow and 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) winds across the northeast US, shutting down travel and schools for millions of Americans.It's the same storm that&nbsp;forced German Chancellor Angela Merkel to delay her meeting with US President Donald Trump until Friday."We're expecting it to be the worst snow of the season," National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist Melissa Di Spigna told news agency AFP.
