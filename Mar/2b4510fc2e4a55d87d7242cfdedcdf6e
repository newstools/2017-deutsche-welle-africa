The UN Security Council voted unanimously Friday to cut more than 3,000 troops from the agency's largest mission.There are nearly 20,000 blue-helmeted troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), but today's vote would reduce that number to little more than 16,200.The move comes despite opposition from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has been investigating war crimes in the DRC since 2004.
