Facing pressure, the government then suspended collection of the tax.The protests have channeled broader discontent against a mismanaged state-run economy under President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for 23 years.Lukashenko initially allowed the protests but this week warned Western intelligence agencies were supporting a "fifth column" of provocateurs to overthrow him. State television tried to back up the claim by reporting the discovery&nbsp;of alleged weapons caches.Like his close ally Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko has long warned of a "color revolution" such as those in Ukraine and Georgia toppling his government.cw/jm (AFP, AP, dpa)
