Unlike during the regular season, when a playoff game is tied at the end of regulation time, the two teams play on until a goal is scored - no matter how long it takes.Two Norwegian League teams, the Storhamar Dragons and the Sparta Warriors put this rule to the test on Sunday night. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw after 60 minutes, meaning Game 5 of their best-of-seven quarterfinal series would have to be decided in overtime.The match was in its 11th 20-minute period when it was finally decided. The Dragons' Joakim Jensen took a pass in the neutral zone, skated over the blue line and let go a slap shot from the faceoff circle that beat the Warriors netminder to win the game in the eighth overtime period - after 217 minutes and 14 seconds of play. On Monday, the sport's world governing body, the International Ice Hockey Federation, confirmed that this was&nbsp;the longest hockey game in history.It could have ended in the seventh overtime period, when Storhamar were awarded a penalty shot, but the attacker failed to convert because, according to a Storhamar report, the player "had no juice in his legs."The two goaltenders faced a staggering 189 shots&nbsp; over the 11 periods (96-93 in favor of Storhamar).The two teams will be hoping for a quicker decision, when they face off for Game 6&nbsp;on Tuesday night.Previous record more than eight decades oldThe longest game in the world's top hockey league, the NHL, - and previously the longest in ice hockey history - came in 1936 when the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1-0 on a goal by Mud Bruneteau that came after 176 minutes and 30 seconds of play.A game in Germany's top flight, the&nbsp;DEL, game came close to that in 2008 when the Cologne Sharks beat the Mannheim Eagles 5-4 - after 168 minutes and 16 seconds. It has now dropped from the second to the third-longest game in history.pfd/rd (dpa, SID, AP)
