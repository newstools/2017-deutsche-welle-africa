The White House and US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have blasted the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks for publishing a trove of confidential intelligence materials detailing CIA hacking operations.White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was "extremely concerned" about the CIA security breach that led to the leak, adding that the disclosure should have everybody outraged."This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security and our well-being," he told reporters.

"Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm."Widespread spying capabilityWikiLeaks on Tuesday published some 9,000 confidential documents detailing how the CIA could use sophisticated software to hack into Apple iPhone and devices running Google's Android operating system to capture text and voice messages before they become encrypted.The documents also revealed how the CIA could turn a TV into a listening device, purportedly bypass popular encryption applications on smartphones and even potentially control a target's car.Major technology brands, including Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Samsung and Microsoft, said they would be looking into how their products are affected.Investigations pendingAlthough the CIA has yet to confirm whether the leaked&nbsp;documents are authentic, US media reported Wednesday that&nbsp;the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would launch a&nbsp;probe&nbsp;in conjunction with the CIA into the leak.&nbsp;The investigation will reportedly explore how the files came into WikiLeaks' possession and establish whether the breach came from inside or outside the CIA.
