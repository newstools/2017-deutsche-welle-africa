Turkey's spy agency has identified hundreds of alleged supporters of exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah G len living in Germany, compiling details into a dossier and passing it on to Berlin, a German media report says.As well as names, the list contains addresses, telephone numbers and photos taken in secret through surveillance cameras,&nbsp;according to the S ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper (link in German). It's said to identify more than 300 people and 200 various clubs, schools, and other institutions with alleged links to G len.Germany's foreign intelligence chief was given the list last month by his Turkish counterpart during the Munich Security Conference. That has allowed authorities across the country to warn those on the list that they have been watched by Turkey.One German state has gone further, with the state criminal office of North-Rhine Westphalia warning those concerned that possible reprisals await them if they return to Turkish territory.The Turkish government blames G len, who lives in the United States, of orchestrating the unsuccessful military coup attempt last July. Turkey has since launched a&nbsp;massive crackdown on dissent and accused supporters of G len, who has denied any part in the insurrection, of being terrorists.Controversial referendumThe details come as Turks living in Germans began voting in an April constitutional referendum that would consolidate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's powers, if passed.&nbsp;Critics say that it would effectively end democracy in Turkey and give Erdogan autocratic powers.The run-up to the ballot has seen relations&nbsp;sour between Turkey and the EU after European authorities canceled several rallies where Turkish officials were to campaign. Some 1.4 million Turkish citizens in Germany are eligible to vote in the referendum.German Chancellor Angela Merkel rebuked Erdogan publicly after the Turkish leader accused both Germany and the Netherlands of engaging in "Nazi practices" by preventing the Turkish ministers'&nbsp;rallies.On Monday, the president of Germany's parliament, Norbert Lammert, said Erdogan, through the April referendum, was attempting to "transform an undoubtedly fragile, but nonetheless democratic system into an authoritarian system.""This second coup attempt threatens to be successful," Lammert added, and criticized the "incomprehensible" consent of Turkey's parliament to its own disempowerment.Swiss open probe into Turkish spyingLast week, Switzerland began a criminal investigation into allegations Ankara had spied on expatriate Turks.It follows the filming of several events at the University of Z rich, including a discussion of the 1915 Armenian genocide by Ottoman Turks - a term which the Ankara government vehemently rejects -&nbsp;and another where the editor-in-chief of the Turkish newspaper "Cumhuriyet" was honored.jr/gsw (S ddeutsche Zeitung,&nbsp;AFP, Reuters) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2ZqXe
