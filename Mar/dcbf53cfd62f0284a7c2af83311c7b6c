German Tornado reconnaissance jets taking part in the US-led anti-Islamic State mission in Syria provided intelligence that may have led to dozens of civilians deaths earlier this week, German media reported on Wednesday.At least 32 civilians were killed on Tuesday in an airstrike on a school building housing displaced persons in the northern Syrian town of al-Mansura, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of the&nbsp;IS stronghold of Raqqa, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Pictures taken of the building by Tornado jets a day before the airstrike were provided to the anti-IS coalition, Germany's "S ddeutsche Zeitung," NDR and WDR reported. They then flew a follow-up mission to assess the impact of the airstrikes.German military inspector general, Volker Wieker, reportedly met with parliament's defense committee in a closed door session to discuss the incident on Wednesday.The Tornado reconnaissance aircraft fly missions from Turkey's Incirlik airbase as part of the US-led anti-IS mission but do not conduct airstrikes.A defense ministry spokesperson told dpa news agency that there is a time lapse between when pictures are provided to the anti-IS coalition and a decision to carry out an airstrike. The spokesperson said the pictures do not provide enough information to determine if militants or civilians are at any particular potential target.The US military has said it has no intelligence to suggest civilians were killed in the airstrike meant to target IS militants. An investigation is ongoing.The coalition said this month at least 220 civilians have been killed since 2014 in airstrikes in Syrian and Iraq, but several monitoring groups say the real number is much higher.&nbsp;
