Prosecutors announced on Monday that they had procured a murder confession in the bizarre case of a missing family that has gripped France for weeks. Authorities in the city of Nantes said that the brother-in-law of Pascal Troadec had admitted to killing the 49-year-old, his wife, and their two children, likely over an inheritance dispute.Sources close to the probe told French news agency AFP on Monday that the suspect, who has not been named, told police that there had been a falling out in the family over the distribution of a large inheritance. They added that the killings had been carried out in a particularly "sordid" manner.Pascal, his wife Brigitte and their children Sebastien, 21, and Charlotte, 18,&nbsp;were last seen on February 16. Brigitte's sister became concerned and phoned the police, who headed for the family's home in Orvault, a suburb of Nantes.Describing the house "as if time froze," investigators said they found dirty dishes in the sink and clothes still in the washing machine. Pascal and Brigitte's cars were still in the driveway.&nbsp; The only clues were traces of blood on a watch belonging to the mother and the son's cell phone. The family's other mobile devices were nowhere to be found. Police also said there had been clear attempts to clean up the crime scene.Clues scattered along the coastThe next breaks in the case at first left investigators baffled. Nearly 300 kilometers (175) miles away in the parents' hometown of Brest, a jogger found a pair of trousers and a health insurance card belonging to Charlotte Troadec. The next day&nbsp;Sebastien's car was found at a third location on the western coast of France, the port of Saint-Nazaire.At first, Sebastien was considered a major suspect by authorities, having been prosecuted as a minor for making death threats online and allegedly suffering from mental illness. After finding his uncle's DNA at the house and in the car, however, police swiftly detained the man and his wife in Brest on Sunday.They now believe that the scattered evidence may have been part of a larger plan to lead investigators on a wild goose chase.After being questioned for 21 hours, Pascal Troadec's brother-in-law was set to be charged and jailed sometime later on Monday. His wife's role in the suspected murders remains unclear.es/msh (AFP, AP)
