Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim&nbsp;said a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been "good and productive," but he also derided the decisions taken this week by two German towns to block rallies with Turkish ministers ahead of an April referendum in Turkey. He called on Berlin to reconsider the decisions.Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag was due to speak in Gaggenau in western Germany on Thursday but his speech was canceled, while the town of Frechen on the outskirts of Cologne scrapped a rally that had been scheduled for Sunday.Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, whose had been set to speak in Frechen, will instead deliver his remarks Sunday at a private event in Cologne, the daily "K lner Stadt-Anzeiger" reported on Saturday. He will reportedly be at a private event at the Senats Hotel near the city's famed cathedral.

They will give a lesson in democracy to the whole word," he said to the crowd of supporters."Mrs. Merkel says [Germans] respect freedom of expression; the foreign minister says we have no impact on this decision, but if you look carefully at both, they do not criticize the decision&nbsp;of the German towns," Bozdag said on Saturday.Merkel holds firmMerkel has defended the decision made by local officials&nbsp;and questioned whether basic freedoms were being upheld in Turkey.
