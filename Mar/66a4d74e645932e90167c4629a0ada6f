IOC member and multiple Olympic and world medalist over 100 and 200 meters Frankie Fredericks has stepped down from an IAAF (International Associaton of Athletics Federations) task force following a corruption scandal related to the awarding of the 2016 Games to Rio. Switzerland's Patrick Baumann replaces Fredericks as head of the IOC commission monitoring candidates for the 2024 Olympic Games.Last week, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) announced an investigation into the allegations concerning Fredericks made in the French newspaper "Le Monde". The newspaper reported that Fredericks received almost 284,000 euros ($300,000) via the company of Papa Massata Diack, the son of former IAAF president Lamine back in 2009.The payment occured the same day Rio was awarded the Olympics in a vote in which Fredericks was a scrutineer. Fredericks said the $300,000 was for "services rendered" to promote the sport in Africa between 2007 and 2011.One of the most senior figures at the IAAF and IOC, Fredericks said he had done nothing wrong in receiving the money. "I have decided to step aside from the task force so that the integrity of its work is not questioned due to the allegations made against me in Le Monde," Fredericks was quoted as saying in an IAAF statement Monday."I categorically deny any direct or indirect involvement in any untoward conduct and confirm that I have never breached any law, regulation or rule of ethics in respect of any IOC election process," he added.The IOC said in a statement on Friday: "As far as Mr Fredericks is concerned, he informed the IOC and explained the situation and emphasized his innocence immediately upon being contacted by the journalist." On Wednesday, the IOC echeod their statement, stating they "the presumption of innocence" in relation to Fredericks.IAAF president Sebastian Coe said in Monday's statement that the taskforce's work was of "utmost importance in rebuilding confidence in Russia whose national system has failed the aspirations of clean athletes and the integrity of competition."jh/rd (AFP/Reuters)
