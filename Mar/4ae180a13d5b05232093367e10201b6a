Noah's suspension was announced on Saturday, when the NBA confirmed he'd tested positive for&nbsp;Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator LGD-4033, a substance intended to produce effects similar to those of anabolic steroids.&nbsp;The over-the-counter supplement is banned under the current league bargaining agreement with the players union.The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) said neither Noah nor the union will appeal the suspension."After a thorough investigation, the NBPA believes that Joakim Noah did not intentionally or knowingly violate any policy," a union statement said. "We believe that this isolated occurrence was a regrettable mistake. Joakim has offered his deepest apologies for this infraction."The NBPA said Noah was "completely forthcoming and cooperative" throughout the investigation.The 32-year-old&nbsp;has not played since a knee operation last month and his ban will begin with the first NBA regular-season or playoff game for which he is eligible and physically able to play, which means he looks likely to miss the start of next season.&nbsp; &nbsp;mp (AFP/DPA)
