The report "Inheriting a Sustainable World: Atlas on Children's Health and the Environment," released on Monday by the the UN's public health&nbsp;arm, noted that globally about 25 percent of deaths of children younger than 5 were caused by unhealthy or polluted environments.&nbsp;More than 90 percent of the world's population is thought to breathe air that violates quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization (WHO), the report noted."A polluted environment is a deadly one - particularly for young children," WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement. "Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water."
