Hertha Berlin 1-2 Hoffenheim (Pekarik 32' --- Kramaric 39' (pen) + 86', S le 76')Fourth visited fifth in the Bundesliga's Friday evening fixture, and Hoffenheim managed to secure three big points in the Olympiastadion.&nbsp;For a brief period after half an hour, Hertha appeared to be in control. Right-back Peter Pekarik scored his first ever Bundesliga goal, after eight years mostly in Germany, and Hoffenheim looked extremely shaky in the moments that followed.&nbsp;But in the 38th minute, the first of three key turning points came to the aid of Julian Nagelsmann's side. Maximilian Mittelst dt was penalized for handball in the area; Andrej Kramaric put a low penalty into the corner, with Hertha goalie Rune Jarstein just inches away from palming it to safety.After a heated final few minutes of the first half, with Vedad Ibisevic particularly rambunctious but only booked for a series of fouls, the two teams went back to the dressing rooms all square.Mittelst dt's woes were not over, though. Ten minutes into the second period, he was dismissed for a studs-up tackle, leaving Hertha a man down.Hoffenheim went on the attack immediately, but spurned a string of chances to take the lead. Kramaric hit the woodwork twice in a single move, first the crossbar and then the post, and Kerem Demirbay clattered the aluminium once more moments later.&nbsp;In the end, center back Niklas S le broke the deadlock for Hoffenheim with a thunderbolt struck from distance, saying after the game that he had only pulled the trigger because he felt he was having a bad game and wanted to make amends.&nbsp;Ten minutes later, the result already in little doubt, Sandro Wagner put a low cross on a plate for Kramaric, who gratefully gobbled up his second of the night. Wagner had also drawn attention early in the game during a clash with Ibisevic, when he dislocated his index finger. After a loud scream as the team doctor popped it back into its socket, the big striker jogged straight back onto the pitch.&nbsp;The defeat, Hertha's sixth in their last 11 games, means that Cologne could claim fifth in the table with a win in Hamburg on Saturday.&nbsp;For Hoffenheim, three points propels them into third in the table, at least temporarily.&nbsp;Dortmund will need to beat rivals Schalke in Saturday's big derby to reclaim the final automatic Champions League qualification spot.
