A Paris court ruled on Thursday that the American artist and the Centre Pompidou museum in Paris, which intended to show Koon's&nbsp;sculpture "Naked," must&nbsp;pay 20,000 euros ($21,225) in compensation to the family of the well-known photographer&nbsp;Jean-Fran ois Bauret, who died in 2014.In addition to paying the heirs of the late&nbsp;photographer, Koons and the museum are required to pay 20,000 euros&nbsp;in legal fees. The artist will also have to pay an additional 4,000 euros for showing the sculpture on his website.Bauret's work also depicts two naked children in a similar pose. It was released in 1975 and was distributed on a postcard.The court ruled Jeff Koons' sculpture "Naked," pictured here on his website, looks too much like another work of artKoons' statue, which is from 1988, was originally intended to be shown at the French museum for contemporary art, but was not exhibited due to damage it sustained while being transported.One version of "Naked" was also sold in 2008 for $8 million.Another one of Koons' sculptures was also removed from the exhibition on suspicion of plagiarism. The complaint came from the creator of an advertising campaign for the clothing company Naf-Naf. He claimed the statue of a pig lying next to a half-naked woman was taken directly from his ad.Koons has been convicted of plagiarism several times already.sh/eg&nbsp;(AFP, dpa)&nbsp;
