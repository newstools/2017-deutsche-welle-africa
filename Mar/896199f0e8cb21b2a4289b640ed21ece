The UK's decision to divorce from the European Union was not a move towards isolationism but rather an opportunity to become "even more global and internationalist in action and spirit, too," in the words of Prime Minister Theresa May.Since the Brexit referendum, it's been quite common for leading British politicians to suggest that they have been engaged in trade talks with an array of countries and would be in a strong position to ink pacts with them not long after the UK's exit from the European bloc.Among these nations is India, a fast-growing emerging economy with over a billion people that shares historic and linguistic ties with the UK. Both nations are also members of the Commonwealth and share broad mutual interests.A vigorous relationshipOn the economic front, both sides maintain a robust bilateral trade and investment partnership. India is the third biggest investor and second largest international job creator in the UK, whereas Britain is the largest G20 investor in the South Asian nation.A free trade deal between the two nations is likely to solidify and intensify this already strong relationship.London's strong desire for an accord with New Delhi is evident from May's decision to pick India for her first foreign visit outside Europe after taking over as prime minister.

India's talks for a free trade agreement with the EU are a case in point. Brussels and New Delhi launched the negotiations in 2007 and they have yet to conclude them, signaling the hard and tedious work British trade negotiators would face in the future.Major stumbling blockSome say progress on the EU-India deal has been hampered by none other than the UK, owing largely to disagreements over immigration. A key demand of New Delhi in any free trade negotiations is liberalized visa norms for Indian professionals a wish that London hasn't been willing to grant thus far.India will soon overtake Britain to become world's fifth largest economy, a "Forbes" magazine report has said. Economist Rajiv Biswas talks to DW about the impending milestone and the overall state of India's economy. (21.12.2016) As British Prime Minister Theresa May is slated to trigger formal Brexit talks, African nations are gearing up for negotiations of their own. But it's not all doom and gloom since Brexit could work in Africa's favor. (27.03.2017) Details of the Brexit separation are still unknown. But nine percent of German firms with interests in Britain are already planning to move investments elsewhere, the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry found. (28.03.2017) PM Theresa May has said her government will stick to the Brexit plan despite a court ruling allowing parliamentarians to vote on when to start talks. May is in India in her first bilateral trip outside the EU. (06.11.2016) PM May's track record on the issue hasn't won her any friends in India either. As home secretary, she introduced an array of measures to curb immigration, including scrapping the post-study work visa that allowed foreign students a two-year work permit in the UK upon completion of their studies.The steps have slashed the number of Indian students enrolling in British universities by a half."Against this backdrop, we remain less sanguine about a post-Brexit UK and India free trade deal, unless the issue of mobility is addressed," Sumedh Deorukhkar, Asia economist at BBVA Research, told DW."With both economies being predominantly services oriented, freedom of movement of people lies at the core of striking a free trade deal on services," he added.The British government is unlikely to yield to Indian pressure on labor mobility, given that concerns over immigration played no small a part in motivating the Brits to vote to leave the EU. And without settling this issue satisfactorily, the Indian side is unlikely to relent on greater access for British firms to sectors such as the financial services.Post-Brexit arrangementAnother factor that determines the attractiveness for India of a free trade deal with the UK is the nature of Britain's post-Brexit partnership with the EU.That's because almost 800 Indian companies with operations focused across Europe, have their bases in the UK. They would face negative ramifications should London fail&nbsp;to sign a deal with Brussels that would ensure continuity and preclude trade disruption, experts pointed out."Such Indian companies would be directly affected by disruptions in goods trade with Europe, loss of passporting rights, weaker economic growth for the UK and new cross-border tax policies," said Deorukhkar.In this context, the analyst noted, while Brexit allows the UK to be more flexible and independent in setting the contours of its trade deals, "we remain cautious about UK-India trade prospects" in the near future.
