Malaysia on Saturday declared the North Korean ambassador to the country "persona non grata" and ordered the diplomat to leave Malaysia within 48 hours.The move comes nearly three weeks after Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was murdered at Kuala Lumpur's airport after two women allegedly rubbed a toxic nerve agent on his face.

Three others, including an official at the North Korean Embassy and&nbsp;an employee of Air Koryo, North Korea's national carrier, are believed to still be in Malaysia.bik/sms (AP. Reuters, AFP)
