Deutsche Bank announced its new plans in a statement on Sunday, part of what Chief Executive John Cryan called "a significant step forward on the path to creating a simpler, stronger and growing bank."Germany's biggest lender said it planned a capital increase of roughly 8 billion euros ($8.5 billion) beginning on March 20, as the bank faces 15 billion euros in legal fees incurred since 2012.Additionally, it said it will retain Postbank, which had been slated to be sold off, with Deutsche's private and commercial clients and list its asset management "in order to unlock growth potential in the business."The bank also said it will reorganize its structure to focus on three business divisions: its private and commercial bank, asset management, and corporate and investment banking, which will be compromised of corporate finance, global markets and global transaction banking.

"The capital increase will reinforce our financial strength substantially. The new three-pillar structure of our operating business should position us for significant growth, both in revenues and earnings."In December, Deutsche agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement with the US Justice Department for dealing opaque bonds based on home loans in 2005-2007, which helped start the global financial crisis.The lender has been connected to other misdeeds as well, including rigging interest benchmarks with other large lenders and money-laundering. It currently faces some 7,000 separate lawsuits and regulatory cases.
