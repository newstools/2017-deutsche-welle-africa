The government shrugged off international outrage over the move. (26.01.2016) A leader of Denmark's far-right party has managed to revive a border dispute that dates back to the 19th century.

However, it was "utopian" to believe that the police can check "every back room in Denmark."Stoejberg's comments prompted a response on Danish social media, with users "informing" their friends of the best pizzerias in their neighborhood.Taking the cakeThe hardline&nbsp;minister is no stranger to controversy. Two weeks ago, she sparked outrage by posting a picture of herself with a cake commemorating the 50th government measure to tighten immigration law.She was also involved in&nbsp;the push to seize immigrants' valuables and jewelry in order to pay for their stay in immigration centers.According to Danish media, the number of foreigners living illegally in the Scandinavian country has risen from 877 people in 2015 to 1,348 last year. The state, with its population of 5.6 million, has been mostly spared from&nbsp;the immigration wave that hit Germany and Sweden.Illegal immigrants in Denmark often live in miserable conditions, according to Copenhagen's police inspector Kjeld Farcinsen, as cited by the Danish mass-circulation newspaper "Ekstrabladet."The migrants work for very low wages, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 crowns per month (around 270 euros and 540 euros), he told TV2.
