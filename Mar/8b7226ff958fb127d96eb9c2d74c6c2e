Egyptian authorities have raided and shuttered the Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture in Cairo. The center had documented alleged human rights abuses and treated torture victims. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday said that Cairo agreed to easing restrictions on political foundations after meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sissi."Germany's political foundations are in our opinion a very important contribution to the development of civil society," she said.Human rights advocates have criticized Cairo for outlawing foreign funding for local organizations and, at times, shuttering non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture."Development cooperation is going well, but it can also be fortified with this clarification," Merkel said.Any revision of laws regulating NGO activities in the country must pass through the parliament, and could face resistance from el-Sissi's supporters.Curbing migrationMerkel's spokesman Steffen Siebert said in a tweet that both political leaders discussed the importance of bolstering border security and providing assistance for refugees.Citing Egypt's 500,000 Syrian refugees, the chancellor said Germany and Egypt shared a "common task to improve the fate of refugees."Ahead of her visit, Merkel said she would pursue cooperation with Egyptian authorities to stem the tide of migration from the Middle East and Africa to Europe."Without a political stabilization of Libya, we won't be able to stop the human traffickers operating out of Libya who are responsible for by far the most arrivals in Italy," the chancellor said in&nbsp;her weekly podcast.Egypt's porous borders with Libya have provided an easy route for human traffickers to smuggle migrants, many of them from Syria, to ports on the country's Mediterranean coast.Cairo has often turned a blind eye to people smugglers operating from its own coastline, despite a constant naval patrol off its Mediterranean coastline.In 2016, more than 360,000 migrants made the dangerous journey to Europe across the Mediterranean, roughly half of them arriving in Italy from Libya.In late 2014, with the war in Syria approaching its fourth year and Islamic State making gains in the north of the country, the exodus of Syrians intensified. At the same time, others were fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Niger and Kosovo.Vast numbers of Syrian refugees had been gathering in border-town camps in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan since 2011. By 2015, with the camps full to bursting and residents often unable to find work or educate their children, more and more people decided to seek asylum further afield.In 2015 an estimated 1.5 million people made their way on foot from Greece towards western Europe via the "Balkan route". The Schengen Agreement, which allows passport-free travel within much of the EU, was called into question as refugees headed towards the wealthier European nations. Tens of thousands of refugees were also attempting the perilous journey across the Mediterranean on overcrowded boats. In April 2015, 800 people of various nationalities drowned when a boat traveling from Libya capsized off the Italian coast. This was to be just one of many similar tragedies - by the end of the year, nearly 4,000 refugees were reported to have died attempting the crossing.Countries along the EU's external border struggled to cope with the sheer number of arrivals. Fences were erected in Hungary, Slovenia, Macedonia and Austria. Asylum laws were tightened and several Schengen area countries introduced temporary border controls.Critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's "open-door" refugee policy claimed it had made the situation worse by encouraging more people to embark on the dangerous journey to Europe. By September 2016, Germany had also introduced temporary checks on its border with Austria.In early 2016, the EU and Turkey signed an agreement under which refugees arriving in Greece could be sent back to Turkey. The deal has been criticised by human rights groups and came under new strain following a vote by the European Parliament in November to freeze talks on Turkey's potential accession to the EU.With anti-immigration sentiment in Europe growing, governments are still struggling to reach a consensus on how to handle the continuing refugee crisis. Attempts to introduce quotas for the distribution of refugees among EU member states have largely failed. Conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere show no signs coming to an end, and the death toll from refugee sea crossings is on the rise.
