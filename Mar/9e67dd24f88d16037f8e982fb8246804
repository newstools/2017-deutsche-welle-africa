Retired printer and lifelong photographer, Keith Ford, sent in this photo of &nbsp;Santispac Beach, one of the inlets on the west side of Bahia de Concepcion, approximately 800 kilometers south of the Mexican/USA border at Tijuana and halfway down the Baja Peninsula. He writes that&nbsp;is accessed by "only one road through&nbsp;desert country, and passes many small communities as it traverses the peninsula from the western Pacific coast and then across to the east side and the Sea of Cortez. Bahia de Concepcion is a long bay of around 35 kilometers and has fine sandy beaches, many of which are rarely visited. Santispac Beach faces south and has great views of the nearby small islands which are the home to a great variety of sea birds. The whole of Bahia Concepcion is a fish nursery&nbsp;and almost all types of Pacific fish arrive to spawn at various times during a year."Do you have a picture of a beautiful landscape that&nbsp;you want to share with readers??
