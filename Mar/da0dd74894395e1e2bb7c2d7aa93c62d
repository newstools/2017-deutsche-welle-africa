Borussia Dortmund has ruled out the selection of Marco Reus for the second leg of their Champions League last-16&nbsp;tie against Portuguese club Benfica on Wednesday.Reus had to be substituted off just before halftime in Dortmund's 6-2 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, holding the back of his left thigh as he hobbled to the dressing room. Dortmund have not announced an official diagnosis on the injury, but Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said in a press conference after the game that Reus had a muscle injury in his left thigh."That is sad news," Tuchel said. "He has played very consistently and on a very high level for weeks. That is a big loss that will tarnish this win."Reus has had trouble with several different muscular injuries since returning from a sixth-month injury in November. He has missed at least eight games for Dortmund in each of the last four seasons.
