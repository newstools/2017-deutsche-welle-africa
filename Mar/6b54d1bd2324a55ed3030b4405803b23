Britain's exit from the bloc is now expected in 2019.In describing what message should carry the day in Rome, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's motto must be "that we are united, but also united in diversity,""We already have today a Europe of different speeds," she said, adding that the spirit should be that things are "open for every member state to participate;&nbsp;there is no exclusion."French President Francois Hollande also sought to reassure wary partners."It's not about excluding anyone. It's about being able, for those who want to and without the treaties being revised ... to go more quickly, without closing the door on anyone," he said. "But as well, we cannot allow anyone to stop others who want to advance more quickly."Hollande and Merkel see eye-to-eye on the EU's futurePoland's fruitless fightEuropean Council President Tusk, who chaired the final session of the two-day summit, said, "Our main objective should be to strengthen trust and unity within the 27. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."On Thursday, Poland's vain lone battle to block a second term for Tusk, a former Polish premier and archfoe of the current ruling party leader, was symptomatic of growing friction between the West and poorer, ex-communist east as Brexit leaves a hole in EU subsidy budgets.EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker conceded that some countries fear this multispeed Europe could be "seen as introducing a new dividing line, a new kind of Iron Curtain between East and West."
