In an escalating dispute over the election campaigns for Turkey's controversial referendum, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Monday for calm after&nbsp;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday after he likened&nbsp;a cancelation of several rallies for German-Turks to&nbsp;"Nazi practices.""Nazi comparisons are always absurd and out of place, because they lead only to one thing -&nbsp;the trivialising of the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis," Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman&nbsp;Steffen Seibert said.While encouraging Turkey to "talk openly and critically," Merkel's office sought, however,&nbsp;to draw a line under the latest dispute, saying that the two country's should&nbsp;"remember the special meaning of our close relationship and let cool heads prevail."'Absolutely unacceptable'Hours earlier, in an interview with&nbsp;German broadcaster ARD, chief of staff at the chancellery Peter Altmaier, of the Christian Democrats&nbsp;(CDU), described the comparison as "absolutely unacceptable.""The government will also make this very clear" to Turkey, Altmaier said, adding that&nbsp;"there is absolutely no reason to allow ourselves to be reproached over this."'Nazi practices of the past'Speaking at a&nbsp;women's rally in Istanbul on Sunday, Erdogan said Germany wasn't "even close to democracy," claiming&nbsp;that the country's&nbsp;practices "are not different from the Nazi practices of the past.""I thought it had been a long time since Germany left [Nazi practices]. We are mistaken,"&nbsp;he added.Erdogan also warned Berlin not to stop him speaking in Germany if he wanted to.&nbsp;A blood covered resident of Istanbul stands near the Bosphorus Bridge.
