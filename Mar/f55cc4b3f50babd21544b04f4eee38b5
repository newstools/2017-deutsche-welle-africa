The Democratic Unionist Party won Northern Ireland's parliamentary elections, according to results announced Saturday, edging ahead of Sinn Fein by a single seat. At 65 percent, voters turned out in their highest numbers in Thursday's vote, the UK's first regional election since last summer's&nbsp;Brexit referendum."Let us now move forward with hope - hope that civility can return to our politics," Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster, who appeared likely to step down as head of the DUP, said after the results emerged.Sinn Fein pressed Foster to step down pending an investigation of a botched energy scheme that could cost taxpayers 500 million pounds (609 million euros/$615 million), but she stood her ground and accused the nationalists of politicizing the issue. Former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness&nbsp;triggered the election by&nbsp;resigning in January, declaring the vote a referendum on Foster's leadership.Unionist candidates, Protestants' preferred choice, captured less than half the seats for the first time. The DUP won 28 of the 90 seats, but the surging Sinn Fein almost wiped out the 10-seat advantage that the unionists had secured in elections a year ago.

But&nbsp;with relations at their lowest point in a decade, Sinn Fein has insisted that Foster step aside while months of investigations begin into a botched green energy scheme she established - or the party will not re-enter government.
