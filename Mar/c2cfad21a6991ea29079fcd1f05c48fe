According to a government source German Chancellor is due to meet with US President Donald Trump for the first time on March 14. Separately, government spokesman Steffen Seibert, who is currently traveling with Merkel during a diplomatic visit in Tunisia,&nbsp;said&nbsp;"we are not denying" reports of the planned meeting.War of wordsHaving developed a close friendship over eight years of cooperation with former&nbsp;US president Barack Obama, the impending meeting between Merkel and Trump has prompted considerable speculation.In their first phone conversation since Trump's shock election as US president on November 8, Merkel reminded the billionaire of democratic values.Any "close cooperation" must be on the basis of the "values of democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity, regardless of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political belief," she said in a public statement.Merkel has also criticized Trump's decision seeking to ban citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.'Catastrophic mistake'In turn, Trump has been a harsh critic of Merkel's liberal refugee policy, which has seen the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in Germany since 2015.When the German leader was named&nbsp;TIME magazine's Person of the Year in December 2015, Trump tweeted that Merkel was "ruining Germany."Meanwhile, in a&nbsp;joint interview&nbsp;published in&nbsp;German daily&nbsp;"Bild" and British newspaper "The Times" in January,&nbsp;Trump heavily criticized Merkel's&nbsp;open-door policy on refugees, saying she had&nbsp;"made one very catastrophic mistake."

Risqu political messages are a point of pride for D sseldorf, especially if it is something that their rivals in Cologne would not be able to top.Cologne's response was Trump reaching under the skirt of Lady Liberty and dragging his opponent Hillary Clinton by the hair. Russia's Vladimir Putin looks on approvingly.Organizers in Mainz claim that their Monday parade was the longest ever made, featuring 154 floats and spanning for nine kilometers (5.6 miles). One of the floats featured British Prime Minister Theresa May piloting the UK lifeboat after leaving the EU.'Blond is the new brown,' reads the banner carried through the streets of D sseldorf by the figures of Donald Trump, French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, Dutch firebrand nationalist Geert Wilders, and Adolf Hitler. Germans associate the color brown with fascism since the days of Hitler's brownshirts.Another touchy subject Turkey's Erdogan demanded an apology and sued German comedian Jan B hmermann for a vulgar poem about him last year. The writing on the hat is also a play on words, loosely translated as "Erdogone.'D sseldorfers also considered the outlook of Britain triggering its exit from the EU.A float in Cologne took on the populist AFD party which successfully rode the wave of displeasure with Angela Merkel's refugee policy. "Too much anger in your gut and democracy will go to the butt," the writing says, using a German idiom for things going badly.The AfD was also in the crosshairs elsewhere, with this float in D sseldorf mocking the party for spurring on hatred against Muslims and labeling them 'useful idiots' of terror groups.With German elections coming up, the mammoth that is Angela Merkel just might be slain by the agile left-leaning rival Martin Schulz. The sign on the mammoth's flank is also play on Merkel's nickname "Mutti," meaning mommy in German. Author: Jeanette Cwienk, Darko Janjevic ksb/msh (dpa, AFP, Reuters)
