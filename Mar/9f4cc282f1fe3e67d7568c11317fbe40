The head of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA), Ingo Kramer, told German broadcaster ZDF on Monday he was full of hope that German Chancellor Angela Merkel could "achieve quite a lot" during her talks Tuesday with US President Donald Trump in Washington.He noted that German companies had created a total of 700,000 jobs across the United States, using the advantages of unrestricted trade. He warned that free trade was no one-way street.Referring to Donald Trump's protectionist agenda, Kramer indicated that Trump the businessman would finally have to see the benefits of free trade.Current concerns over the US' future economic policy may be justified, but I believe that with a bit of sensitivity these concerns can be minimized or even fully removed," Kramer argued.Trade surplus a thorn in the sideIn 2016, the US was Germany's largest export market, with the US president openly criticizing Germany's trade surplus of 49 billion euros ($52.3 billion) and threatening to levy excessive&nbsp;import tariffs.
