David Silva scored from the penalty spot and Gerard Delofeu from open play to secure a 2-0 morale boost for Spain in their friendly in Paris on Tuesday evening.&nbsp;As well as being a meeting of two of Europe's top teams, the game was notable as another experiment using a video referee during a FIFA match.This excitement was particularly palpable in Germany as the refereeing team happened to be German; Felix Zwayer was in charge of matters on the pitch, but Tobias Stieler was in radio contact nearby, watching the game on a batch of monitors.&nbsp;The technology did alter the outcome. Twice, Stieler - the so-called Video Assistant Referee -&nbsp;was able to override Zwayer on crucial decisions. The video referee waved away&nbsp;Antoine Griezmann's offside goal for France that Zwayer and his on-pitch assistants would have let stand, while also approving Delofeu's goal, which Zwayer had initially disallowed for offside. Assuming no other changes, the game could have ended 1-1 without the technical input.Read: Dortmund's Dembele leads new generation of French talentNo respite for the NetherlandsItaly showed no mercy against the floundering Netherlands on Tuesday. Days after manager Danny Blind's sacking and a defeat to Bulgaria that put the Dutch dreams of World Cup qualification in jeopardy, the Azurri managed to overturn an early&nbsp;deficit to win 2-1 at the Amsterdam Arena.&nbsp;An Italian own goal had opened the scoring, but Eder equalized within minutes. Leonardo Bonucci added another later in the first half - both Italy's goals came from set pieces against the Dutch, now under the stewardship of caretaker coach Fred Grim.&nbsp;Bonucci (shirt number 19, in white) was on hand to mop up the loose ball at a set piece, making it 2-1 ItalyTo the east, Belgium and Russia played out a 3-3 draw.
