Security Council strongly condemned the "heinous and cowardly terrorist attack", saying that the perpetrators, organizers and financiers needed to be held responsible.&nbsp;Troubled securityWednesday's attack comes just a week after simultaneous Taliban suicide assaults hit two security compounds in Kabul, killing 16 people.The security situation in the country continues to be unstable, with security forces bracing for the start of the Taliban's fighting season in the spring after repeated bids to launch peace negotiations with the group have failed.Afghan forces have been struggling to put down the Taliban insurgency on their own since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.tj/mb/jm (AFP, dpa, Reuters)
