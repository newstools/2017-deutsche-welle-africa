A unique coin was stolen from the Bode Museum in Berlin&nbsp;early&nbsp;Monday morning, at around 3:30 a.m., as stated in a tweet by Berlin's police: The face value of the coin is one million dollars, but its market value is estimated at four&nbsp;million dollars. Called the "Big Maple Leaf," the piece&nbsp;weighs 100 kilograms (220 pounds). Issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007, like all Canadian coins,&nbsp;it features the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. It has a diameter of 53 centimeters (21 inches) and is three centimeters thick.&nbsp;The piece&nbsp;has also entered the Guinness Book of Records for its unsurpassed purity of 999.99/1000 gold.On show at&nbsp;the Bode Museum since 2010, it is&nbsp;part of the&nbsp;M nzkabinett collection, Berlin's most important archive of coinage, which includes&nbsp;more than 540,000 objects altogether.The thieves are believed to have broken into the building located on Berlin's famous Museum Island by setting up a ladder from the adjacent tram&nbsp;tracks. The rail service was interrupted when the ladder was found. Investigators have not revealed how the burglars managed to avoid setting off alarms and leave&nbsp;the museum unnoticed while&nbsp;carrying the heavy piece.eg/kbm (dpa, AFP)&nbsp;
