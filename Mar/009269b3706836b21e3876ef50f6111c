Although it may not be very well known outside of the United States, funding via government institutions, on the national, state, county and municipal levels,&nbsp;is one way the country supports its artists. For the time being at least.Arts and humanities&nbsp;in the United States have received financial support from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) since 1965. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which subsidizes non-commercial radio and television programming,&nbsp;was founded two years later.All three institutions may be on the chopping block, however. The Trump Administration is expected to propose a budget in the coming weeks that does away with funding for the institutions. US Congress is expected to vote on the budget&nbsp;in April.The cuts would likely eliminate a number of projects that could not exist without federal funding. Click through&nbsp;the pictures above to find out more about the kinds of activities that are threatened by these proposed cuts.
