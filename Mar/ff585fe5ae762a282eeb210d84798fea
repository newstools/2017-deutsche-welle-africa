The city of Trier, located in the western part of Germany near the border with Luxembourg, was the hometown of Kark Marx. For his 200th birthday in 2018, China wants to offer a 6.3-meter (21-foot) bronze representation of the revolutionary socialist thinker. The city is to decide if it will accept the gift on Monday.Trier&nbsp;tested the possibility by setting up a wooden model of the planned statue&nbsp;over the last two weeks (top picture), leading to immediate negative reactions from some citizens:&nbsp;"Setting up a statue of a man who played a major role in the development of Communism is a shame and not an honor for Trier," wrote one person&nbsp;in&nbsp;the local newspaper.Other city authorities see things differently: "This has nothing to do with glorification. Those times are over," said Wolfram Leibe, mayor of the city and&nbsp;member of the Social Democratic party.&nbsp;Several discussions have been held over the last few months over the statue and the importance&nbsp;of the philosopher and economist&nbsp;as a historical figure.Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, and spent the first 17 years of his life in Trier before studying in Bonn and then Berlin. Trier is preparing a special exhibition for his 200th anniversary next year, "Karl Marx 1818-1883. Life. Work. Times."eg/ (dpa, KNA) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Yb1E
