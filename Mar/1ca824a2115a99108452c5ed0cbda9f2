Russia's state-run broadcaster Channel One on Thursday poured scorn on the idea of its contestant competing via a remote satellite link.The offer came after Ukraine's security service barred 27-year-old Russian Eurovision hopeful&nbsp;Yulia Samoylova from entering the country for three years.The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs Eurovision, had said it was deeply disappointed by Kyiv's decision. However, it said it had to respect the laws of the host nation and made the offer of a remote broadcast to&nbsp;the final in Kyiv, should the Russian entry make it that far.Channel One rejected the idea, claiming that the idea of performing via a remote link was strange, given that&nbsp;live performances are a prerequisite for entrants.A wheelchair-bound singer is Russia's Eurovision contestant in Kyiv. Ukraine should welcome her, writes Andreas Brenner. (13.03.2017) Ukraine has barred Russia's Eurovision contestant from entering the country because she previously performed in Crimea. Relations between the neighbors have deteriorated since Moscow's 2014 annexation of the territory. (22.03.2017) "We find the offer of remote participation odd and refuse it, for it is going absolutely against the very essence of the event, one of the rules of which reads that the song should be performed live on the stage," Channel One said in an English language statement spurning the offer.Ire over 'Eurohate'Russian state media reacted with indignation to the entry ban for Samoylova, who has been in a wheelchair since she was a child after a bad reaction to a vaccine.The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda headlined its Thursday paper "Eurohate," and said the ban was "spitting in the face of defenseless" Samoylova.Samoylova&nbsp;herself said she could not understand why Ukrainian authorities saw "some kind of threat in a little girl like me."Ukraine imposed the entry ban on Samoylova&nbsp;because she was said to have illegally entered the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula to perform in a 2015 gala concert. Kyiv considers any entry to Crimea by non-Ukrainians to be an affront unless they are first granted permission.The status of Crimea is a particularly sensitive issue in Ukraine since it was annexed by Russia in 2014.The song contest in Kyiv comprises two semi-finals on May 9 and 11, with a final on May 13.
