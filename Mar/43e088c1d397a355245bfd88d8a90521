He's confused about what he wants.""He's confused about what he wants. It's somebody who's just realizing that he has these feelings. And Josh makes something really subtle and delicious out of it," Condon added.Speaking at the film's Los Angele's premier on Thursday evening, Gad said&nbsp;he was "very proud" of the scene.'LGBT agenda'Hot on the heels of the announcement, evangelist Graham wrote on Facebook:&nbsp;"They're trying to push the LGBT agenda into the hearts and&nbsp;minds of your children - watch out!""I hope Christians everywhere will say no to Disney," the preacher added.Following suit,&nbsp;movie theater in Alabama announced on Friday that "it is with great sorrow" that they had to tell&nbsp;customers they will not be showing "Beauty and the Beast.""When companies continually force their views on us we need to take a stand," Henagar Drive-In wrote on its Facebook page."We are first and foremost Christians. We will not compromise on what the Bible teaches," the post added.Elsewhere, however, Disney's decision has been praised as a "wonderful step forward.""This is incredibly&nbsp;important for the youth of today," said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, the LGBTQ media advocacy group."They need to see themselves&nbsp;reflected in the media they consume. More and more, as studios want&nbsp;to appeal to youth audiences, they're going to have to include LGBTQ&nbsp;story lines and characters."Due to open in Germany on March 16, some box office analysts&nbsp;have predicted that the remake of the 1991 classic&nbsp;could&nbsp;bring in more than $100 million (94 million euros) in North America alone on its opening&nbsp;weekend.ksb/bw (AP, Reuters)
