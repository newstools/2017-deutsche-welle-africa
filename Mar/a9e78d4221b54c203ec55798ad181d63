The Greek&nbsp;international controlled a poor clearance from Leipzig's Naby Keita, and dribbled around Diego Demme before firing a shot from way outside the penalty area to give Augsburg the early 1-0 lead.&nbsp;Keita made up for his turnover six minutes later by threading a through ball to Werner, who snuck in a shot off the post for the equalizer.

"The manner in which Leipzig is destroying Salzburg is disappointing," he had told German newspaper Bild after joining Augsburg in September of 2016.But he did his former club proud on Friday, scoring the equalizer for Augsburg that gave them a very valuable point at home. The Austrian defender galloped down the field on a break before receiving a pass from Koo Ja-Cheol and finishing past Peter Gulasci in Leipzig's goal.Hinteregger played down the "revenge angle" after the game. "We played well and that is what was great," he told Sky Sport in Germany after the game.
