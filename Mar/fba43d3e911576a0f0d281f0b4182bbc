"She is inspiring everyone at a moment when we need inspiration," he said.Two petitions, generous press attention and interest on social media generated a push for keeping the statue where it is.The 50-inch (127 cm) bronze statue of a defiant girl with fists on hips was installed to mark International Women's Day on March 8 under a lease due to end April 2."She has clearly struck a nerve," New York Democratic lawmaker Carolyn Maloney said on Monday as she stood on the steps of City Hall with other women politicians to announce the statue's extended stay."She has really, really become a meaningful part of the community of New York," Maloney said. "Everyone sees their own dreams and aspirations in the strength of this little girl."Original artist unhappyCommissioned by asset manager State Street Global Advisors, the female figurine&nbsp;is part of a campaign to increase gender diversity in business.The gender diversity campaign by State Street Global Advisors, a subsidiary of State Street Corp, aims to highlight the need for more women on corporate boards.
