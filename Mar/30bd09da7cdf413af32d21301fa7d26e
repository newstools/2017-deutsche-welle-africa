UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres arrived in Iraq on Thursday in a visit aimed at assessing the growing humanitarian crisis as Iraqi and allied forces, backed by US-led airstrikes, fight to recapture the northern city of Mosul from extremist "Islamic State" (IS) militants.A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission to Iraq (UNAMI) said Guterres would meet the Iraqi president, prime minister and parliamentary speaker&nbsp;before heading north to visit camps sheltering people displaced by the Mosul conflict.The fight to retake the city has triggered a number of humanitarian concerns, with more than 350,000 people fleeing the battle since the government offensive on Mosul began in October, according to UN figures.Many civilians remainOfficials and witnesses say that airstrikes during the operation to take the western part of the city, which started last month, have also taken a devastating toll on civilians who have remained.The US-led coalition that has been carrying out strikes against IS says it "probably" played a role in reported civilian deaths in west Mosul.

But Iraqi forces, with the backing of the US-led airstrikes, have&nbsp;since recaptured much of the area.tj/sms (AFP, AP)
