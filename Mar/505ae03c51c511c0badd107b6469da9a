El Salvador's congress on Wednesday approved a law banning all metals mining in order to protect the environment.Some countries have banned strip mining and open-pit techniques, but the bill passed in El Salvador prohibits all underground, above-ground or artisanal mining for metals.Supporters of the bill say the ban is necessary to protect water resources and reduce social tensions."Mining is not an appropriate way to reduce poverty and inequality in this country. It would only exacerbate the social conflict and level of water contamination we already have," the charity Oxfam's El Salvador Country Director Ivan Morales said.The measure passed with 69 votes out of 84 possible, with the support of all parties.Mining for salt, stones or sand will still be allowed. The law also bans the use of toxic cyanide and mercury for mining.cw/bw&nbsp;(AP, Reuters, EFE)&nbsp;
