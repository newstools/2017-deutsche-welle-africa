Arab leaders on Wednesday said they would renew&nbsp;a historic reconciliation offer with Israel in return for its withdrawal from land it has occupied since the 1967 war.By some estimates, the two-state solution has been dead for years. With Israeli leadership turning ever more to the right and a White House that seems fine with that, the two-state solution may have taken its last gasps. (27.03.2017) The two-state scenario of Palestinians living alongside Israel remains the "only sensible alternative," Chancellor Angela Merkel has told Mahmoud Abbas in Berlin. The Palestinian president is also due to visit Brussels. (24.03.2017) Trump has spoke with the leader of Palestine about reviving peace talks with Israel. An invitation for Mahmoud Abbas to visit Washington suggests a shift in Trump's previous position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (11.03.2017) A communique read out at the end of Wednesday's Arab League summit on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea said that "peace is the strategic option" and that Arab states would back Palestinian-Israeli peace talks if they guaranteed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -&nbsp;all of which Israel captured and to varying extents continues to occupy.Such a deal would dictate that Palestinian statehood must precede any normalization in relations between Israel and Arab world. The endorsement undercuts Israel's peace proposal where normalization would precede any deal with the Palestinians.Arab leaders had previously pitched such a "reconciliation" deal back in 2002.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the summit resolutions would "send a clear message to the world" of a united Arab stance, while Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Arab Summit ended with a "message of peace."

During his speech on Tuesday to AIPAC, the pro-Israel American lobby group, Netanyahu gave little lip service to the notion of a two-state solution.&nbsp;The summit's host, Jordan's King Abdullah II, reaffirmed the region's position that the creation of a Palestinian state would form the basis of any peace deal."Israel is continuing to expand settlements and wreck chances of peace," he said. "There is no peace or stability in the region without a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian cause through a two-state solution."Arab leaders also urged countries the world over not to relocate their embassies and consulates in Tel Aviv to the disputed city of Jerusalem, something Trump has said he intended to do.&nbsp;The summit came ahead of a series of White House talks with Arab leaders. Jordan's King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are all scheduled to meet with Trump.dm/jm&nbsp;(Reuters, AP) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2Y9KF
