Samsung attaches big hopes to the release of its Galaxy S8 smartphone, which has already generated global interest for its sleek design and premium features including the digital assistant Bixby.The world's leading smartphone maker is attempting to win back consumer trust while bolstering its credentials as the main rival of US tech giant Apple. On its website, Samsung says the latest addition to the Galaxy lineup represents "the start of a new era."US-based online news network The Verge described the new device as Samsung's "biggest test ever," because the tech giant needed to "reassert its reliability while also rebooting its technological advantage."'All-screen' handsetSamsung has offered little information about its new hardware features. Some leaked images of the new phone suggest the Galaxy S8 will sport a larger curved display than its predecessor the S7, showing that the company is focusing on an "all-screen" device design.The home button on the front of the phone appears to have been replaced by a fingerprint scanner on the rear, while it is also speculated to have an iris scanner, most likely used for unlocking the handset and authorizing payments.The S8 is to be officially launched at 11am EST (1500 GMT) in New York, with the new handset expected to be available in late April with a price range of around $900 (833 euros) to $1,000.

The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility.JK Shin, Samsung's chief executive in charge of the mobile division, said the company would make sure the Note 7 problem "never gets repeated," adding that Samsung "will revive our premium image by improving designs through differentiation and introducing innovative intelligence interfaces."For some analysts, the S8 has the potential not only to challenge Apple's iPhone but also shake up the broader smartphone market.uhe/jd (Reuters, dpa, AFP)&nbsp;
