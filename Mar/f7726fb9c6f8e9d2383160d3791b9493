"In recent weeks it has been increasingly observed that Muslim pupils in the school building are praying, clearly visible to others, signaled by ritual washings in the toilets, the rolling out of prayer mats, and taking up certain postures.""This is not permitted."So read an internal message to teachers at Gymnasium Johannes Rau in Wuppertal, western Germany, banning prayer for its Muslim students.

And in this, a country as deeply religious as Germany, which has become as open and tolerant as we are today.""Even our shepherdess constantly calls upon a thorough knowlege of the Bible," he added in an apparent reference to Chancellor Angela Merkel.Referring to Germany's Constitution, another user asked: "What was that again about religious freedom? Article 4 of the German Constitution?"Elsewhere on Facebook other users praised the decision: "I think the letter's great. Such things do not belong in a school."Another asked: "Can we allow them to roll out their carpets in the school?"Praise from anti-Islam AfDThe Wuppertal branch of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD)&nbsp;was also quick to respond, describing the measure as an "interesting and, in our opinion, sensible initiative by the school management."In a separate Facebook post, the local AfD fraction added: "This openly demonstrated lack of integration is a further proof of a cracking migration policy of the old parties."'Unfortunate wording'Following Thursday's report in "Der Westen," management at the school was unable comment.Supporting the school in its decision, however, spokeswoman for the local district council Dagmar Gross&nbsp;told DW that "the ban on praying in a 'provocative way' in the school is intended to promote peaceful coexistence and ensure the school peace."Staff and students at Gymnasium Johannes Rau reportedly felt 'under pressure' by the prayer rituals of fellow studentsThis measure was intended to provide a solution "since several teachers and students felt themselves under pressure due to the behavior of the classmates," she added.Despite standing by the Gymnasium, the local district council admitted, however, that "unfortunate choice of words" could be misunderstood.Prayer is possible Gross&nbsp;added, "if it does not affect the running of the school."

The constitutional decree for the functioning of a school and the educational mission (Article&nbsp;5 of the German Constitution) prevails over Article 4, the right to profess a religious or philosophical creed, Gro explained."Therefore, for example, Muslim girls must also take part in swimming lessons," she added.Prayer court caseThe ban in Wuppertal isn't the first instance in which schools have dealt with prayer by Muslim students.In 2011, a high-school student from Berlin-Wedding went to court, because he was not allowed to pray publicly at his school on Fridays.Germany's Administrative Court rejected his complaint, however, on the grounds that his prayers would disturb the school peace.
