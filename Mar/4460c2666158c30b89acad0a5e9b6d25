After reporting on Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's rally in Hamburg this week, journalist Sebastian Kempkens on Wednesday revealed in German daily "Die Zeit" that he had been struck with flags and hit in the face by rally-goers.Kempkens admits that the confrontation began after he "departed from his role as a journalist and became an activist for press freedom." As Cavusoglu accused Germany of jeopardizing Turkey's strength, Kempkens raised a banner demanding the release of German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who was detained in Turkey in February. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had called Yucel a "German agent" and a "terrorist."Kempkens reported that within a matter of seconds of raising the sign, a woman read what he had written and called him out as a "provocateur." He says he was suddenly barraged with flags, shoved into a hostile crowd and hit in the face, knocking off his glasses.Shortly afterwards, having been pushed towards the exit, Kempkens said that five men pushed him against a wall of the Turkish consulate, where Cavusoglu' was speaking. "Piss off out of here and something bad is going to happen to you," one allegedly said. "You can thank Erdogan's humanity that you're still alive," said another.The Senate of Hamburg, the city-state's executive branch, has reportedly asked the Turkish consulate "to help in clarifying the incident and to take a stance." In a statement, the Senate stressed that freedom of expression and a free press were fundamental rights, and that intimidation or physical attacks were considered unacceptable.Courting German-TurksCavusoglu's speech from the balcony of the Hamburg consulate was one of a several of referendum rallies Turkish ministers are seeking to hold in Germany, were some 1.4 million eligible Turkish voters reside.
