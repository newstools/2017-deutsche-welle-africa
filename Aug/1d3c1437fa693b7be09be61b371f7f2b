Dutch police arrested two people overnight in connection with a terror threat at a concert canceled in Rotterdam on Wednesday.The concert, by the US band the Allah-Las, was called off after Dutch police received a terror alert from Spanish officers. Two hours later the Spanish driver of a van that contained gas canisters was arrested just a few hundred meters from the concert venue, although reports now indicate he had no relation to the terror threat.On Wednesday, Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told a hastily called press conference that it was too early to establish a link between the vehicle and the warning. "We can't say that yet," Aboutaleb said."It would be wrong at this moment to pile up these facts and conclude: thus there was a plan to attack with gas bottles, et cetera, because that was the picture last week in Barcelona," Aboutaleb said. "I would be careful with that."Read more: Barcelona terror attack suspect admits larger plotOn Thursday, the daily Volkskrant and several other outlets reported that the man, who appeared to be drunk at the time of his arrest, was a mechanic who said he needed the gas bottles for his job. Second arrestEarly Thursday morning authorities arrested a second person, Dutch outlets reported. The 22-year-old was arrested in the province of Brabant by special forces.Reuters subsequently quoted a judicial source in Madrid as saying the van found in Rotterdam was not connected to last week's attacks in Barcelona and adjacent areas of Catalonia in which 14 people were killed. A Spanish counterterrorism official told "Associated Press" the same thing.Band from LANo offense intended in name choice, says Michaud.Rotterdam police said they had taken seriously the warning from Spanish police and "after discussion with organizers it was decided to cancel the event." The concert organizer Rotown had tweeted that Wednesday night's performance at the Maassilo venue - a towering former grain silo complex - had been canceled on orders from police.Allah-Las is a four-piece band from Los Angeles.Rotown said the cancellation decision preceded the concert's intended start.Only a few of the 1,000 expected guests had reportedly arrived when the harbor-side venue was evacuated.Dutch television showed police in in body armor outside Maassilo and what appeared to be band members leaving in a white vehicle with a police escort.The Dutch news agency ANP said the band left the venue under police protection.The French news agency AFP said the tip-off from Spanish authorities was received at about 5:30 p.m. (1530 UTC). The large building was searched by a Dutch anti-terror squad.Band 'unharmed'A representative from the Allah-Las' label, Mexican Summer, told the Associated Press news agency that the group's members were safe."The band is unharmed and are very grateful to the Rotterdam Police and other responsible agencies for detecting the potential threat before anyone was hurt," the rep said.Last year, band members told the British newspaper The Guardian that they chose the word Allah, Arabic for God, because they were seeking a "holy sounding" name and did not realize it might cause offense to Muslims.aw, ipj/mkg (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)
